CustomerReviews: "first off I came here on a Monday morning thinking on a slow day they would want the business. I pull up to place and the lady staff was setting up bikes outside. Before getting my question off she insisted on reminding me that they were not open till 10:00. Without a delay or hesitation she told me she could not do anything without her mechanic there.. So I guess she is just there to set up bikes I guess.. Nice job title.. Probably hire someone with more skill sets.so I got back in my car because asking my question just seemed wrong?? I guess. If I didn't need this part asap I would of rather gone to target or Walmart or gave my money to a homeless man before I give a cent to Two Wheels One planet .. They have rude staff and not very intelligent ones either. Train them in customer service not on how to ride bikes. I felt so bullied and threatened .now normally in customer service you want to make your customers feel welcomed. This lady is a joke, she is rude and had no customer service ! If this is the kinda of staff that this place chooses to hire then they will never see me again. We have lived off flower st our whole lives and have come to this place for all our biking needs because as a kid they made you feel welcomed .i will never return and will never ever recommend this place to anyone!!",

CustomerReviews: "Absolutely exceptional customer service. I needed two tune ups on my bikes and I was hoping to get them back by the end of the day-the shop was busy (as it is the last weekend before Christmas), but the warranty tech Brent was happy to help and went above and beyond to make sure everything was ready to go for me. When we walked in we were immediately greeted, and helped right away. While we were filling out the paper work for the bikes, we were approached by two different gentleman asking if we had been helped and if we needed anything to drink. I also saw one gentleman bring a cup of water to a guest that was waiting. Absolutely amazing customer service at a bike shop-I was impressed to say the least. I also needed assistance purchasing new front and rear lights for my bikes- Will was knowledgeable and explained my options and helped me find exactly what I was looking for. Great atmosphere in this shop... Everyone is eager to help, and you can tell that everyone is passionate about their jobs and they enjoy what they do. I highly recommend visiting this store for any biking or repair needs, and would certainly recommend that you ask for Brent or Will. Way to go guys!",

CustomerReviews: "after my incredibly shitty experience at two wheels one planet, i'm now dealing with the clusterfuck aftermath of a crappy installation.  my kickstand is sticking out and blocking the path of the pedals, and it looks like i'll have to adjust it myself.and the U-lock?  the mechanic installed it in the worst possible place: directly in front of the seat so it's sticking up and almost the same height as the seat.  i discovered how bad the location was today after making a quick stop which forced me to hop forward off my bike and onto -- yikes -- the lock.  my poor, poor lady parts!  WTF kind of place is this for a lock?!?!?  granted the way it mounts makes it difficult to put on my bike, but the least the mechanic could have done was to tell me this and suggest another lock rather than forcing this improper lock onto a horrible spot on my bike.i'm out almost a hundred bucks and have nothing to show for it except a smooshed crotch and a wonky kickstand.

It's working out well thus far.The store also supports the Bike Club of Irvine (BCI) which is a good reason to give them your business if possible.

Jonathan asked about my goals for the bike and walked though various options in my price range, explained the bands, differences in models, etc., and encouraged a few test rides.  Very no pressure explanations, very knowledgeable.  After a little more online research, I went back and bought the bike Jonathan thought would be ideal and could not be happier with my purchase.Having lived in the area for years, I've seen this shop hundreds, if not thousands of times, but had never been in.

The decor is great, lots of old and unique bicycle memorabilia all over the place. My biggest complaint about this place is the bikes that they sell. I'm not a big fan of the brands and or the quality. Back in the day they offered different brands and better quality bikes. I find myself buying my bikes at other bike stores and then serving everything here. I simply wish the this place offered a better selection.",

CustomerReviews: "Great place to get your biking gear. I've done indoor cycling for a few years now and have finally manned up and decided to take the next step in buying my own cycling shoes. So I decided to come here since the studio that I go to recommended this. I came here on a Sunday and it wasn't too packed. A staff member helped me pick out cycling shoes, but he seemed to not be too knowledgeable on cycling gear (didn't know the difference between SPD and LOOK compatible cycling clips). Nonetheless, he was very honest and oftentimes consulted senior staff about things he didn't know about. When I chose my shoes and clips, he was kind enough to set up our shoes. Really helpful staff, attentive, and great selection of cycling gear here. Definitely will go here for future cycling needs.",

After the sale, Matt called me back for a bike fitting (a place across the street was charging me 100 bucks for it) and spent a considerable amount of time with me on the trainer evaluating my position - he even showed me how to take my rear tire out and repair a flat.Hands down - the best bike shop I've been to in terms of customer service.

CustomerReviews: "I brought my bike in here to have the brakes and tire fixed. The grand total was about 105 bucks which seemed about right to me however, the very next day the tire went flat. I understand that sometimes things happen and this issue might not necessarily be their fault so I brought it in again. This guy told me to take some precautionary measures by buying some stuff called \"slime\" and in spite of what happened still charged me for replacing the tire. Two weeks later both tires go flat with slime in each of them. When I brought it back for a third time they assured me that if it's under the warranty they won't charge me for it. They charge me another $40 to have this fixed. This time it was for lining the insides of the rims or something. So I basically invested $185 at this place to have two tires fixed. The guys here seem nice but it's all bullshit. I came here because the yelp reviews but I won't be back. This company needs to stand by their service better.",

Dave even helped me load my bike in my truck and held the other for me to return for the following day...I will definitely recommend this shop to everyone and will return for my next bike too.",

CustomerReviews: "I highly recommend these guys. Here's how it breaks down:Pros:Super friendly and helpful staffCool shop rides that truly do cater to all levelsThe shop vibe...You can just hang out there and look at stuff on your own, or wrap with somebody who's passionate about cycling as well, or get advice on what to buy, but I guess the thing that's noteworthy is there's no pressure to buy anything.Service that exceeded my expectations. On several occasions I was quoted a 5 to 7 Day turn time for my bicycle repair only to receive a call within 48 hours saying it was ready :-). In addition, I've walked in there needing a minor repair on the way to a ride and they stopped what they were doing and got my bike dialed in, so I didn't miss my ride...That is what it's all about people. Pretty reasonable prices for a brick-and-mortar shop. The cats that work there are all cyclists. Cons:Apparently they're still using hand written repair tickets and dropping your bike off can take a minute. Maybe it's time you think about upgrading the system? Another thing that's really noteworthy is my friend purchased a road bike there. She had the bike about a week and took it on a few rides. A week later she learned she was able to purchase another bike (from a different shop) that was slightly lower priced and far better componentry. They gave her a 100% cash refund two weeks after she purchased the bike, no questions asked. They were super cool about the whole thing.",

CustomerReviews: "I just bought a New Trek FS7 Electric assisted Mountain Bike. If you haven't been to Two Wheels One Planet Bicycle I highly suggest you do. Will and Craig spent a few hours with me explaining all the different bikes and helped me to choose the right one for my riding ability/desire. They have a huge shop with lots of bikes to choose from, so I didn't feel like they were just pushing what they happened to have in stock. I even bought a bike for my 10 year old daughter. I'm really looking forward to a more active lifestyle with my family. Next purchase is another Trek FS7 for my wife now.

But here's the super good news, they would order it in for about $35 all totaled with tax and shipping! Huh? Just about the worst offer ever from a local retailer.

My latest purchase over a year ago was a Giant Bike and accessories, including a wireless odometer.  Two weeks later I brought the bike in for an adjustment like the sales person told me to do and was told they could make me an appointment in about 3 or 4 weeks yet another customer came in at the same time I did....a young girl and he took her bike right in.  Another service rep saw what was happening and rescued me, made a small adjust...took about 2 minutes or less and I was on my way.  Then I decided to give them another try and I've bought a few things in there for my bike.My battery died in my wireless computer so I had to reset it and I wasn't sure what size my wheels were so I dropped by and ask a guy in the service department if he could help me.  First he accused me of not buying the computer there and then he said he couldn't help me because he didn't know how to set it (he works in a bike shop!) and he would have to sit down and figure it out and he had other others he had to do.....although I noticed the store was pretty empty.  I grabbed it out of his hand and left the store for the last time.I will never go back into that bike store again.  Once you buy something you are on your own and they are rude to boot.  I have a large biking group of friends that I'm going to pass on the information of how I was treated.If that guy had worked for me he would be out of there.  Not good with people.Gail Ream",

I'm quite indecisive, and kind of a big pain in the ass, and they totally helped me! I haven't been on a bike in years (I fall off the stationary bikes in spin.

Chris helped me adjust the handlebars, seat, pick out a basket, bell AND the shop threw in FREE FREAKING BLING COVERS FOR MY TIRE VALVE.

I can't say enough wonderful things about this spot. Then they helped us two overly ambitious new bike owners cram a massive beach cruiser and a mountain bike in the hatchback of a Honda Insight. This was a strenuous process, and Chris stayed late to help us shove those suckers in safely.We checked out 3-4 other cycle shops in the area (CM, HB, NB) and this was by far the best. Best prices, bomb employees, and a wonderful selection. Not to mention no sales tax sale? Yes please. GO! We went in to look, and we came out with fully tricked out bikes. Whoops. They're that good! :)) THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING GUYS!!",

CustomerReviews: "LOVE this place!! A good friend of mine referred me to Two Wheels One Planet and told me to talk to Will. I was in need of a new bike seat and a bento box. Will took great care of me!Will also mentioned their Saturday morning group rides and a Thursday evening BYOB (bring your own bike) spin class. I utilized these training opportunities to help me get ready for my first Ironman 70.3. The maintenance team is also wonderful! They fixed up my bike and packed it up for my race in Mexico. =)I highly recommend Two Wheels One Planet for all your bike needs.",

CustomerReviews: "Maybe it was obvious i am not an avid biker.  It was hard to find someone willing to help me even though there were 3-4 staff standing around doing nothing.  When a young man finally did help me (if that was what you want to call it) he was not much help at all and I seemed to be a bother.I tested a bike in the parking lot w/o much assistance to fit.  I purchased the bike because it was on sale and seemed like a good price.  No one offered to assist in getting it in my vehicle.  When I got home with the bike it had a sticker on it saying to read the manuel.  I realized they did not give me a manuel.Maybe the bad service was because I am a woman who is not demanding but believes that good service s/b offered.  Anyway, if you are a female looking for good service it won't be offered at this store.Just my opinion, hope others have better experience.They did seem to have a good selection of bikes and helmets along with decent prices.  So maybe management will read this and give the boys on the store floor a lesson in customer service.",

I added on a cute bell and a rack in the back (sad it was extra) and also sad they don't make the racks to match the bike but none the less- I am so happy with my purchase! The bike was $10 cheaper than we saw anyplace else, and it was 10% off! Accessories were 15% off too (at the time) I think a week before Christmas. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.Long story short, I am the proud owner of my first Electra Beach Cruiser and so happy that I didn't just choose a Walmart bike! $250 well spent  Thanks again babe!

CustomerReviews: "My girlfriend and I purchased two Electra townie bikes with accessories. Our sales man Chris was very informative and helpful. For purchasing two bikes, they were nice enough to give us a accessory package discount. The only reason for not giving them five stars was their lack of communication at the end of the purchase. We had come down to Costa Mesa for the weekend and had friends with us. After the purchase the bikes we waited for about three hours for them, to do a check over on the new bikes. We just stood there not knowing how long it would take. We asked many times how much longer and we were told there working on them.Only if they had communicated with us our day would not of felt waisted.

CustomerReviews: "My man and I relocated here from the east coast and decided that even though we already have bikes, we needed cruisers. We both got Electra 7 speed townies outfitted with bells and baskets and some locks. The really positive things that stood out at this shop:*We walked in a few minutes before close to make the purchase, and they stayed late to outfit the bikes so we could use them that evening. Took about 45 minutes. In the past, when I've had baskets put on, I've had to wait hours or days. Awesome!*The prices are very fair. We had literally purchased the exact same bike as a gift for someone the week before in NY and paid $70 more. Great value.*Complimentary bike maintenance workshops the last Wednesday of every month. I'll definitely be there.*12 month no interest financing, if you need it. I've never seen a shop offer this service before.They didn't mention anything about a 30 day follow up service or free tune up after a year, which most bike shops offer standard. I forgot to ask and am not sure if this is included. I also did notice that their pricing for service seemed on the steep side compared to what I'm used to paying. For those reasons I knocked off a star. Otherwise, great inventory, great prices, fast friendly service.",

The usual stores I have been going into lately are filled with arrogant people who don't give great service unless you spend hundreds of dollars, but this place is different. I went in getting a simple truing only spending around $20 and they treated me like I was spending hundreds there. Because of the service I ended up spending around $200 to get a major tune up and accessories put on by a great guy named Brian. Super cool guy, straight forward, and if you don't know what your talking about they won't make you feel dumb. Highly recommend this place, will do another review about the tune up when I get my bike back after its serviced to inform you on the outcome. Also, they have a free cycling class on Thursday after they close, all you have to do is bring your own bike, that's awesome!",

CustomerReviews: "Since my former 24 Hour fitness spin instructor was opening up his own studio (Full Psycle also on 17th St.) I finally had to give in and get cycling shoes since his new studio would only accept those on their bikes and they recommended LOOK over SPD. Of course that made my life fun, since I had done some researching online and many of the shoes were SPD compatible but not as many choices were LOOK. Checked out other local bike shops for female LOOK compatible shoes for a  good price (was not willing to pay more $100+ and would only get it on sale or for a discount) but found out selections for female LOOK compatible shoes are limited.  Found 3 shoes that made my requirements at Two Wheels One Planet. They had a Bontrager that was compatible to both LOOK and SPD cleats but alas none were available in my size at the time (they are reordering more and can reorder more if you want).  I decided to go check out the HB REI (Tustin's REI sales selection wasn't as good) afterwards and found out they had spin shoes on sale so got my shoes there since the shoes were under $50 and I had gift certificate (WIN for me).   But since I wanted to support the local bike shop and cleats are cheaper here than at REI I got my LOOK cleats here. The staff was helpful and friendly and I got a 15% discount (only on full price items not sales) since it was a referral from Full Psycle and they helped to install the cleats on for me.",

CustomerReviews: "The best bike shop I've ever been to!We've been on the grand tour of bike shops in Orange County to find the right bike.  Of all the shops, mom-and-pop or corporate, Two Wheels One Planet was by far the most pleasurable shop to visit.  All the staff, especially Ryan, were extremely knowledgeable, friendly and most important not pushy or snobby like the staff at a few of the other shops in the area.I would whole heatedly recommend this shop whether you're an experienced cyclist or a newbie getting your first bike.  You won't be disappointed!",

I wanted a beach cruiser and they helped me pick the perfect bike for me and they immediately had it all ready to go and they delivered it to my house. The customer service was so great, I went back the following week and purchased a bike for my son. I highly recommend!",

CustomerReviews: "The first time I went in Hayden helped me try out different bikes and sent me home with a few bikes to look up so I could make the right choice. I really appreciated the time he took to show me a variety of bikes and teach me a bit about the different features. After some homework, I ordered a Trek FX 2 (2017) from these guys and they had it ready in less than a week. When I went to pick it up, Jonathan helped me get familiar with the bike and put on some of the accessories I had for it. It's my first bike (ever) and he took the time to explain everything I needed to know and then some. (Thanks, Jonathan!)Another awesome thing about this place is that they include a complete tune up after 90 days and free adjustments for the lifetime of the bike :) All in all, I am really happy I purchased my bike here. The service is excellent and the employees are knowledgeable and patient.",

I could not be more pleased with the shoes and my experience at Two Wheels One Planet. Dustin, the associate that applied my cleats was also very friendly, efficient  and helpful.

CustomerReviews: "There are several bike shops around Costa Mesa, but this is the best!  They have a great selection of bikes and accessories, but it is their staff that places them a cut above the competition.  The sales and service staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and they focus on doing all of the little things right.For example, earlier this week I dropped my bike (2001 Dyno Cruiser) off for a tune-up appointment with Lane in the service department.  My bike was promised by 6 the next day, but it was finished several hours early. I like that, because I LOVE my bike so much that I can't really imagine not having it for a week or two (yeah, I know I sound weird, but I really like riding my bike).  The is especially remarkable since everybody and their mom seemed to be having their bike tuned up for the summer this week.There was a short line when I picked my bike up, but Michelle in the service department was quick to acknowledge each customer in line. That kind of attention really makes customers feel important, it made me feel important.  I was also wowed at how quickly and efficiently she saw to it that each customer in line was taken care of.  Kind of made me want to give her a high five when I finally got to the counter!  I didn't, but maybe next time...In short, these guys treat their customers with respect.  Go see them and you'll know what I mean.",

I stopped by the service counter this morning to pick up a screw for my pedal. Pretty minor but I would rather have come here than anywhere else. Loyalty is earned after all.The guy on the service counter was immediately rude to me, stating that he wouldn't have time to look for a pedal screw for about three hours but I could leave my bike there until he found time. So I could wait three hours, pay the five bucks he quoted me for the screw or he suggested I buy new pedals.I was pretty pissed off at how rudely the guy met my request and don't think I deserved this attitude.Was it really worth losing a customer over a pedal screw? I think I can find other bike stores in the area.He was the older service guy with the grey hair.",

He showed us low and moderately priced bikes and didn't try to sell us more than we needed. I had done my homework on pricing for the bikes I thought we might buy, and their prices were the same as internet dealers--lower than a few, higher than one. Plus they had an end of the month special that saved us $150 if we spent $1,000 or more, which we did (the bikes were $599 and $499). We were out the door with bikes, helmets, locks, lights, lube and a few maps for about $1225, and the bikes were adjusted and fitted to us. Very happy.",

Absolutely NO pressure and we felt like he was legitimately there to help us find the perfect bike.  He encouraged my wife to ride a couple bikes and she fell in love with the Townie bike.  Jeff told us he had the bike in white but it wasn't built yet.  He called the next day like we requested and said the bike was built and ready for viewing.  We went back down and again he was very patient and attentive.  My wife rode a couple of the bikes again and eventually found the perfect bike for her.  We left the shop and went down to the strand and immediately went on about a 9 mile ride.  She loves the bike and we will continue to patronize this shop and it was a great experience.

However, I opted for a Giant Roam 1, men's small, and ended up at the Costa Mesa store, which is closer to where I live.  Also, thanks to Jared, in Lake Forest, who guided me to the perfect dual-sport bike for my needs!I can't explain how helpful they were in every category!  Accessories were added and liners were put in my tires and the bike was ready when promised.  They're easygoing and knowledgeable, which is the perfect combination for me.

CustomerReviews: "What is it with bike shops and poor customer service and spiteful, know-it-all jackasses? I came in here years ago to get a spoke repaired. I came back in to pick it up only to be told they needed to replace all of them. I looked at the wheel and they had put 3 spokes of the wrong color on my rim and tried to charge me for them. I refused and left. I wasn't trying to be an entitled ass, but they were such tools about it I couldn't help but return the favor. I should have learned my lesson.Fast forward to now and I need to get the same wheel respoked. Long story short the fix is twice the price of a new wheel set. This news was delivered to me so begrudgingly I almost barfed. There was one tech guy who was very nice, and I wish that I could put his name here because he's why they got an extra star. Not everyone knows EVERYTHING about bikes, that's why you have a service department.Long story short, I'm at City Grounds and am very happy.",

Before getting my question off she insisted on reminding me that they were not open till 10:00. Without a delay or hesitation she told me she could not do anything without her mechanic there.. So I guess she is just there to set up bikes I guess.. Nice job title.. Probably hire someone with more skill sets.so I got back in my car because asking my question just seemed wrong?? I guess. If I didn't need this part asap I would of rather gone to target or Walmart or gave my money to a homeless man before I give a cent to Two Wheels One planet .. They have rude staff and not very intelligent ones either. Train them in customer service not on how to ride bikes. I felt so bullied and threatened .now normally in customer service you want to make your customers feel welcomed. This lady is a joke, she is rude and had no customer service ! If this is the kinda of staff that this place chooses to hire then they will never see me again.

I needed two tune ups on my bikes and I was hoping to get them back by the end of the day-the shop was busy (as it is the last weekend before Christmas), but the warranty tech Brent was happy to help and went above and beyond to make sure everything was ready to go for me. When we walked in we were immediately greeted, and helped right away. While we were filling out the paper work for the bikes, we were approached by two different gentleman asking if we had been helped and if we needed anything to drink. I also saw one gentleman bring a cup of water to a guest that was waiting. Absolutely amazing customer service at a bike shop-I was impressed to say the least. I also needed assistance purchasing new front and rear lights for my bikes- Will was knowledgeable and explained my options and helped me find exactly what I was looking for. Great atmosphere in this shop... Everyone is eager to help, and you can tell that everyone is passionate about their jobs and they enjoy what they do. I highly recommend visiting this store for any biking or repair needs, and would certainly recommend that you ask for Brent or Will. Way to go guys!",

CustomerReviews: "after my incredibly shitty experience at two wheels one planet, i'm now dealing with the clusterfuck aftermath of a crappy installation.  my kickstand is sticking out and blocking the path of the pedals, and it looks like i'll have to adjust it myself.and the U-lock?  the mechanic installed it in the worst possible place: directly in front of the seat so it's sticking up and almost the same height as the seat.  i discovered how bad the location was today after making a quick stop which forced me to hop forward off my bike and onto -- yikes -- the lock.  my poor, poor lady parts!  WTF kind of place is this for a lock?!?!?  granted the way it mounts makes it difficult to put on my bike, but the least the mechanic could have done was to tell me this and suggest another lock rather than forcing this improper lock onto a horrible spot on my bike.i'm out almost a hundred bucks and have nothing to show for it except a smooshed crotch and a wonky kickstand.  DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HELLISH EXPERIENCE TO CONTINUE LONG AFTER YOU LEAVE THE STORE.",

CustomerReviews: "After researching the best seat pack for my race bike, I stopped by to purchase the Bontrager Mini Pack by TREK.  The sticker price on it was a few $$ more than the full retail price on the TREK website which is usually the highest retail price that you would pay for something.I showed the manager of the store the printout from TREK who made a price adjustment to TREK's price, and I purchased the pack.  It's working out well thus far.The store also supports the Bike Club of Irvine (BCI) which is a good reason to give them your business if possible.  BCI is a great community bike club for all skill levels.",

Jonathan asked about my goals for the bike and walked though various options in my price range, explained the bands, differences in models, etc., and encouraged a few test rides.  Very no pressure explanations, very knowledgeable.  After a little more online research, I went back and bought the bike Jonathan thought would be ideal and could not be happier with my purchase.Having lived in the area for years, I've seen this shop hundreds, if not thousands of times, but had never been in.

Nonetheless, he was very honest and oftentimes consulted senior staff about things he didn't know about. When I chose my shoes and clips, he was kind enough to set up our shoes. Really helpful staff, attentive, and great selection of cycling gear here. Definitely will go here for future cycling needs.",

I brought my Trek 830 mountain bike (1992 vintage) in for a tune up and new parts on March 20 and was told it would be ready on March 28. I received a call during lunch on March 23 and promptly went to pick up my ride. It was in beautiful condition. After riding it for the first time since the repairs, I can say I have never enjoyed riding that bike as much as I do now...after all this time.

After the sale, Matt called me back for a bike fitting (a place across the street was charging me 100 bucks for it) and spent a considerable amount of time with me on the trainer evaluating my position - he even showed me how to take my rear tire out and repair a flat.Hands down - the best bike shop I've been to in terms of customer service.

CustomerReviews: "I brought my bike in here to have the brakes and tire fixed. The grand total was about 105 bucks which seemed about right to me however, the very next day the tire went flat. I understand that sometimes things happen and this issue might not necessarily be their fault so I brought it in again. This guy told me to take some precautionary measures by buying some stuff called \"slime\" and in spite of what happened still charged me for replacing the tire. Two weeks later both tires go flat with slime in each of them. When I brought it back for a third time they assured me that if it's under the warranty they won't charge me for it. They charge me another $40 to have this fixed. This time it was for lining the insides of the rims or something. So I basically invested $185 at this place to have two tires fixed. The guys here seem nice but it's all bullshit. I came here because the yelp reviews but I won't be back. This company needs to stand by their service better.",

CustomerReviews: "I highly recommend these guys. Here's how it breaks down:Pros:Super friendly and helpful staffCool shop rides that truly do cater to all levelsThe shop vibe...You can just hang out there and look at stuff on your own, or wrap with somebody who's passionate about cycling as well, or get advice on what to buy, but I guess the thing that's noteworthy is there's no pressure to buy anything.Service that exceeded my expectations. On several occasions I was quoted a 5 to 7 Day turn time for my bicycle repair only to receive a call within 48 hours saying it was ready :-). In addition, I've walked in there needing a minor repair on the way to a ride and they stopped what they were doing and got my bike dialed in, so I didn't miss my ride...That is what it's all about people. Pretty reasonable prices for a brick-and-mortar shop. The cats that work there are all cyclists. Cons:Apparently they're still using hand written repair tickets and dropping your bike off can take a minute. Maybe it's time you think about upgrading the system? Another thing that's really noteworthy is my friend purchased a road bike there. She had the bike about a week and took it on a few rides. A week later she learned she was able to purchase another bike (from a different shop) that was slightly lower priced and far better componentry. They gave her a 100% cash refund two weeks after she purchased the bike, no questions asked. They were super cool about the whole thing.",

A lot of customers came in while I was there to visit and everyone had a couple questions.I'll come back for a challenge of history questions.Thanks guys!",

CustomerReviews: "I just bought a New Trek FS7 Electric assisted Mountain Bike. If you haven't been to Two Wheels One Planet Bicycle I highly suggest you do. Will and Craig spent a few hours with me explaining all the different bikes and helped me to choose the right one for my riding ability/desire. They have a huge shop with lots of bikes to choose from, so I didn't feel like they were just pushing what they happened to have in stock. I even bought a bike for my 10 year old daughter. I'm really looking forward to a more active lifestyle with my family. Next purchase is another Trek FS7 for my wife now. Check out my picture, I just took the bike out, first ride and in 30 minutes I climbed over 1,300 feet in 30 minutes!",

But here's the super good news, they would order it in for about $35 all totaled with tax and shipping! Huh? Just about the worst offer ever from a local retailer.

My latest purchase over a year ago was a Giant Bike and accessories, including a wireless odometer.  Two weeks later I brought the bike in for an adjustment like the sales person told me to do and was told they could make me an appointment in about 3 or 4 weeks yet another customer came in at the same time I did....a young girl and he took her bike right in.  Another service rep saw what was happening and rescued me, made a small adjust...took about 2 minutes or less and I was on my way.  Then I decided to give them another try and I've bought a few things in there for my bike.My battery died in my wireless computer so I had to reset it and I wasn't sure what size my wheels were so I dropped by and ask a guy in the service department if he could help me.  First he accused me of not buying the computer there and then he said he couldn't help me because he didn't know how to set it (he works in a bike shop!) and he would have to sit down and figure it out and he had other others he had to do.....although I noticed the store was pretty empty.  I grabbed it out of his hand and left the store for the last time.I will never go back into that bike store again.  Once you buy something you are on your own and they are rude to boot.  I have a large biking group of friends that I'm going to pass on the information of how I was treated.If that guy had worked for me he would be out of there.  Not good with people.Gail Ream",

I'm quite indecisive, and kind of a big pain in the ass, and they totally helped me! I haven't been on a bike in years (I fall off the stationary bikes in spin. I'm THAT bad), and they let me take out a beautiful cruiser a few times. Chris helped me adjust the handlebars, seat, pick out a basket, bell AND the shop threw in FREE FREAKING BLING COVERS FOR MY TIRE VALVE. This obviously cinched the deal in my mind that I'd found the best store ever. My husband got some fancy bike, and they sized him up and fit him to a perfect one also. I can't say enough wonderful things about this spot. Then they helped us two overly ambitious new bike owners cram a massive beach cruiser and a mountain bike in the hatchback of a Honda Insight. This was a strenuous process, and Chris stayed late to help us shove those suckers in safely.We checked out 3-4 other cycle shops in the area (CM, HB, NB) and this was by far the best. Best prices, bomb employees, and a wonderful selection. Not to mention no sales tax sale? Yes please. GO! We went in to look, and we came out with fully tricked out bikes. Whoops.

When I got home with the bike it had a sticker on it saying to read the manuel.  I realized they did not give me a manuel.Maybe the bad service was because I am a woman who is not demanding but believes that good service s/b offered.  Anyway, if you are a female looking for good service it won't be offered at this store.Just my opinion, hope others have better experience.They did seem to have a good selection of bikes and helmets along with decent prices.  So maybe management will read this and give the boys on the store floor a lesson in customer service.",

CustomerReviews: "My boyfriend and I had been to 4-5 other bike shops and after the sad realization that Electra does not make a 1-speed in yellow, I went with a bright pink Electra Beach Cruiser! I added on a cute bell and a rack in the back (sad it was extra) and also sad they don't make the racks to match the bike but none the less- I am so happy with my purchase! The bike was $10 cheaper than we saw anyplace else, and it was 10% off! Accessories were 15% off too (at the time) I think a week before Christmas. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.Long story short, I am the proud owner of my first Electra Beach Cruiser and so happy that I didn't just choose a Walmart bike! $250 well spent  Thanks again babe!

CustomerReviews: "My girlfriend and I purchased two Electra townie bikes with accessories. Our sales man Chris was very informative and helpful. For purchasing two bikes, they were nice enough to give us a accessory package discount. The only reason for not giving them five stars was their lack of communication at the end of the purchase. We had come down to Costa Mesa for the weekend and had friends with us. After the purchase the bikes we waited for about three hours for them, to do a check over on the new bikes. We just stood there not knowing how long it would take. We asked many times how much longer and we were told there working on them.Only if they had communicated with us our day would not of felt waisted. We could of enjoy our limited vaca time and return later to pick up our new bikes.",

CustomerReviews: "My man and I relocated here from the east coast and decided that even though we already have bikes, we needed cruisers. We both got Electra 7 speed townies outfitted with bells and baskets and some locks. The really positive things that stood out at this shop:*We walked in a few minutes before close to make the purchase, and they stayed late to outfit the bikes so we could use them that evening. Took about 45 minutes. In the past, when I've had baskets put on, I've had to wait hours or days. Awesome!*The prices are very fair. We had literally purchased the exact same bike as a gift for someone the week before in NY and paid $70 more. Great value.*Complimentary bike maintenance workshops the last Wednesday of every month. I'll definitely be there.*12 month no interest financing, if you need it. I've never seen a shop offer this service before.They didn't mention anything about a 30 day follow up service or free tune up after a year, which most bike shops offer standard. I forgot to ask and am not sure if this is included. I also did notice that their pricing for service seemed on the steep side compared to what I'm used to paying. For those reasons I knocked off a star. Otherwise, great inventory, great prices, fast friendly service.",

The usual stores I have been going into lately are filled with arrogant people who don't give great service unless you spend hundreds of dollars, but this place is different. I went in getting a simple truing only spending around $20 and they treated me like I was spending hundreds there. Because of the service I ended up spending around $200 to get a major tune up and accessories put on by a great guy named Brian. Super cool guy, straight forward, and if you don't know what your talking about they won't make you feel dumb. Highly recommend this place, will do another review about the tune up when I get my bike back after its serviced to inform you on the outcome. Also, they have a free cycling class on Thursday after they close, all you have to do is bring your own bike, that's awesome!",

CustomerReviews: "Since my former 24 Hour fitness spin instructor was opening up his own studio (Full Psycle also on 17th St.) I finally had to give in and get cycling shoes since his new studio would only accept those on their bikes and they recommended LOOK over SPD. Of course that made my life fun, since I had done some researching online and many of the shoes were SPD compatible but not as many choices were LOOK. Checked out other local bike shops for female LOOK compatible shoes for a  good price (was not willing to pay more $100+ and would only get it on sale or for a discount) but found out selections for female LOOK compatible shoes are limited.  Found 3 shoes that made my requirements at Two Wheels One Planet. They had a Bontrager that was compatible to both LOOK and SPD cleats but alas none were available in my size at the time (they are reordering more and can reorder more if you want).  I decided to go check out the HB REI (Tustin's REI sales selection wasn't as good) afterwards and found out they had spin shoes on sale so got my shoes there since the shoes were under $50 and I had gift certificate (WIN for me).   But since I wanted to support the local bike shop and cleats are cheaper here than at REI I got my LOOK cleats here. The staff was helpful and friendly and I got a 15% discount (only on full price items not sales) since it was a referral from Full Psycle and they helped to install the cleats on for me.",

When I went to pick it up, Jonathan helped me get familiar with the bike and put on some of the accessories I had for it. It's my first bike (ever) and he took the time to explain everything I needed to know and then some.

During my most recent visit, I was interested in a new pair of cycling shoes. Will answered my questions, made comparisons, presented several options and eventually made an excellent recommendation. I could not be more pleased with the shoes and my experience at Two Wheels One Planet. Dustin, the associate that applied my cleats was also very friendly, efficient  and helpful. I highly recommend Two Wheels One Planet.",

They helped me with everything to get set up, and any problems I just bring them the bike and they take care of it right away. I think they focus on specific types of bikes, I got an Electra Townie and it's great for me. There may be other bike shops more suited to the hard core bicyclist, but if you are like me and are in need of expert help to start and maintain a biking habit, check out 2 Wheels 1 Planet!",

CustomerReviews: "There are several bike shops around Costa Mesa, but this is the best!  They have a great selection of bikes and accessories, but it is their staff that places them a cut above the competition.  The sales and service staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and they focus on doing all of the little things right.For example, earlier this week I dropped my bike (2001 Dyno Cruiser) off for a tune-up appointment with Lane in the service department.  My bike was promised by 6 the next day, but it was finished several hours early. I like that, because I LOVE my bike so much that I can't really imagine not having it for a week or two (yeah, I know I sound weird, but I really like riding my bike).  The is especially remarkable since everybody and their mom seemed to be having their bike tuned up for the summer this week.There was a short line when I picked my bike up, but Michelle in the service department was quick to acknowledge each customer in line. That kind of attention really makes customers feel important, it made me feel important.  I was also wowed at how quickly and efficiently she saw to it that each customer in line was taken care of.  Kind of made me want to give her a high five when I finally got to the counter!  I didn't, but maybe next time...In short, these guys treat their customers with respect.  Go see them and you'll know what I mean.",

I stopped by the service counter this morning to pick up a screw for my pedal. Pretty minor but I would rather have come here than anywhere else. Loyalty is earned after all.The guy on the service counter was immediately rude to me, stating that he wouldn't have time to look for a pedal screw for about three hours but I could leave my bike there until he found time. So I could wait three hours, pay the five bucks he quoted me for the screw or he suggested I buy new pedals.I was pretty pissed off at how rudely the guy met my request and don't think I deserved this attitude.Was it really worth losing a customer over a pedal screw? I think I can find other bike stores in the area.He was the older service guy with the grey hair.",

He showed us low and moderately priced bikes and didn't try to sell us more than we needed. I had done my homework on pricing for the bikes I thought we might buy, and their prices were the same as internet dealers--lower than a few, higher than one. Plus they had an end of the month special that saved us $150 if we spent $1,000 or more, which we did (the bikes were $599 and $499). We were out the door with bikes, helmets, locks, lights, lube and a few maps for about $1225, and the bikes were adjusted and fitted to us. Very happy.",

We knew we wouldn't be buying something the first day as the search had just begun.  The manager \"Jeff\" greeted us and was amazingly helpful.  Absolutely NO pressure and we felt like he was legitimately there to help us find the perfect bike.  He encouraged my wife to ride a couple bikes and she fell in love with the Townie bike.  Jeff told us he had the bike in white but it wasn't built yet.  He called the next day like we requested and said the bike was built and ready for viewing.  We went back down and again he was very patient and attentive.  My wife rode a couple of the bikes again and eventually found the perfect bike for her.  We left the shop and went down to the strand and immediately went on about a 9 mile ride.  She loves the bike and we will continue to patronize this shop and it was a great experience.

However, I opted for a Giant Roam 1, men's small, and ended up at the Costa Mesa store, which is closer to where I live.  Also, thanks to Jared, in Lake Forest, who guided me to the perfect dual-sport bike for my needs!I can't explain how helpful they were in every category!  Accessories were added and liners were put in my tires and the bike was ready when promised.  They're easygoing and knowledgeable, which is the perfect combination for me.

CustomerReviews: "What is it with bike shops and poor customer service and spiteful, know-it-all jackasses? I came in here years ago to get a spoke repaired. I came back in to pick it up only to be told they needed to replace all of them. I looked at the wheel and they had put 3 spokes of the wrong color on my rim and tried to charge me for them. I refused and left. I wasn't trying to be an entitled ass, but they were such tools about it I couldn't help but return the favor. I should have learned my lesson.Fast forward to now and I need to get the same wheel respoked. Long story short the fix is twice the price of a new wheel set. This news was delivered to me so begrudgingly I almost barfed. There was one tech guy who was very nice, and I wish that I could put his name here because he's why they got an extra star. Not everyone knows EVERYTHING about bikes, that's why you have a service department.Long story short, I'm at City Grounds and am very happy.",

The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.",

CustomerReviews: "Downtown Santa Ana has no shortage destinations to eat. Luckily I work super duper close and this was one of the first places I checked out. Specializing in fresh made to order kebabs, salads, wraps. This place deserves a gold star. Located on 4th street in the hope you find parking zone. Bring those quarters for the meter. Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread. Paired with garlic sauce and a green sauce. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. In fact, I couldnt help myself and busted open my box on my way home and grabbed a bite. It was so good. House made salad dressing was one of the best I've had.Service is friendly. The owner takes great pride in his food. Yelp check in scores you one free appetizer and drink.Can't wait to return.",

CustomerReviews: "Came here based off yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint, everything was wonderful!!! I'm so full right now shared the Sultan platter with my wife and we also had the sampler appetizer. The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again.

The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.",

Little shops that just give you good food.Walked up to the counter and grabbed a menu.  I had the chicken kebab platter.  The guy behind the counter who looked kind of like one of the bad guys from the Christopher Reeves Superman movie was super friendly.  Definitely not the bad guy.  He asked if I wanted half rice and half salad, which sounded perfect.  Grabbed a drink from the cooler, paid and we sat to wait for our food.  Another guy brought over a little something to chew on, which was good.  It didn't take long for the food to come by.  It was great.  So good.  The chicken had a little spice, but was perfect with the yogurt sauce they gave.I live nowhere near here, but if I was in the area, I would be there often.

CustomerReviews: "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.",

In the area that it's located, it was a super quiet street.  Everything is street parking with it being metered pay during the day.  It was very quiet for a lunch time with not too many people dining in.My biggest complaint was the service I received.  For the place not being so busy, it took forever for someone to take my order and then even longer for my food to come out.  The lady serving me was not very attentive and was very rude about everything.  She kind of threw my food on the table when she finally got it to me.  And when taking a peak back into the kitchen, everything done did not seem too sanitary.  The lady at the cash register was serving food in between taking orders and handing bills without washing her hands in between which I'm sure you're not suppose to do.On a positive note, they offer complimentary pita bread and a green herby dipping sauce which came out warm and delicious.

CustomerReviews: "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

CustomerReviews: "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.",

CustomerReviews: "First of all I don't even know how this place got bad reviews. I would come here again based off on the customer service alone. Rok runs the restaurant and has a fantastically friendly attitude.  My hunch is that he was probably the man who taught chick-fil-a there customer service skills! Lol Aside from the amazing customer service, the food was great. I eat Mediterranean food a few times a week and always make it a point to try new spots and I am very glad I came. Looks like this will be added to the rotationI ordered the combo kebab, chicken and steak with half rice and salad. It also came with complimentary warm pita and a tasty dipping sauce. The meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everything was tender, fresh, and aromatic. You could tell they put a lot of TLC into there food. Overall no complaints here! Now What are you waiting for go try it! Thank you Rok!",

CustomerReviews: "The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.",

CustomerReviews: "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.",

CustomerReviews: "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.",

I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!",

The greek stoner fries with waffle fries, gyro meat, tzaziki sauce and feta were amazing.  We had the sultan plate with the chicken kebab, steak kebab, and kibbeh kebab.  Not a big fan of kibbeh in general, but my wife like it.  The steak kebab was good, but the chicken kebab was amazing, juicy, tender, and flavorful.  We tried a felafel appetizer as well which was also very good.  We will come back next time we are in the area.",

CustomerReviews: "We came in tonight just before closing. Usually not a good thing to do as the pickings can be slim and the quality unknown. Boy we're we wrong. It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight. We will be back.",

CustomerReviews: "I decided to come to Kebab Place based off of the location and the reviews. The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.",

When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad",

At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

CustomerReviews: "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.",

I had the salmon kebab and I couldn't have been happier. Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it.

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.",

Yelp reviews didn't let me down as this place has great food and owner was real appreciative of our business. Kebab meat from salmon, beef, and chicken was cooked perfect. Everything was flavorful from pita bread to meat to veggies and sauces. Portions are good as well!",

I knew there was a problem when the couple behind me was served their food prior to mine...and they had full plate dinners.  I was brought the wrap with French fries.  I waited another 10 minutes to be brought two burnt small felafel.  The gyro meat was a bit too salty.  Sorry",

I had the salmon salad with some pita on the side. The salmon had a crispy sear on the outside but soft on the inside, just delish.  The pita was really warm and soft. I could've made a meal out of the pita and assorted dips alone, it was that good. Restaurant was clean, food came out quick and the new owner was really nice and energetic.

CustomerReviews: "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!",

CustomerReviews: "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.",

Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

Prior to my arrival I phoned the establishment and spoke with Gita who was very sweet in taking down my order and provided some tips on keeping the food/dessert fresh out in the desert. Once I got to kebab place, I was greeted by Gita and a gentleman named Rock (owner) who was speaking very highly of the food and baklava. We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten. My campmates also appluaded the quality of the baklava and I was compelled to leave a positive review!!! Will definitely be seeing Rock and Gita in the near future.",

CustomerReviews: "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.",

When I tried to order in person what I had ordered thru doordash one week prior, he told me their system was different and that he'd have to charge me for two separate kabobs which came out to $5 extra.. so $20 for one plate! The right thing to do from a customer service standpoint would've been to honor that price shown online. Very disappointing. Won't bother going there again.",

My husband And I both had the Kevin plate which came with your choice of meat, grilled veggies an option for half salad and half rice. Pitta bread with a side dipping sauce was also provided. The food was fresh and flavorful! The portion size is large and fulfilling. We are already planning to try the grilled salmon kebob next time.  If your not in the mood for kebobs, they also have burgers and gyros with fries. The customer service is warm and friendly, with family owned vibes.

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.",

It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalape\u00cc\u00c4\u00e5\u00b1o cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice. Well priced for the amount and quality of food Inside the place is small but clean. Would definitely go back again when in the area.",

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice.

It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less.

The rice was also well done and authentic.  A grilled Hot Pepper was served on the site with a grilled tomato garnish.  The tzakiki sauce is REALLY good!Over all, an excellent experience.  Great for a date with cozy tables!Loved it!",

Thank you for coming to DTSA!I stepped out of my salon to have lunch and didn't want to frequent my usual spots Crave or Cafe Calacas (both are wonderful !) so I kept walking down 4th and walked past this spot but made a u-turn straight into this spot!I believe I met the owner who was very nice and charming. The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio. My clients will love the quality of freshness from this great spot!I will be back and I have been spreading the word so hopefully they are here to stay!",

I had the gyros wrap and it was amazing! It had so much meat on it and the meat had perfect flavor.  It was a large portion too.....I was really full afterward!Some of my lunch partners had the kabob plate and it was a kabob, rice, and salad and they said it was great too. We were able to walk here, order, eat, and make it back on time with 10 mins to spare. If you are in jury duty, I recommend walking here for lunch....it beats the court cafeteria by far!!

CustomerReviews: "So I would give this place five stars for the quality of their food but was not happy with their service. We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good",

The rice was also great, especially when combined with the yogurt sauce. My son ate the steak plate and thought it was delicious. Food all seemed fresh, and customer service was wonderful. Will definitely be back for more.",

It's not the kind you put in the office that's frozen, no this is the true legit stuff that comes off a spit!  The portion sizes are nice so you won't leave hungry.  The pita's are fresh and warm.  The tzatziki sauce is really flavor full.  The hummus isn't bad but it's not my cup of tea...it's very heavy in the garlic department so if your warding off vampires you will love this!",

The seasoned fries are bomb ASF, super delicious, made as soon as you order! By far the greatest tasting food in DOWNTOWN! Great place, small but great for social gatherings. I visit almost daily .

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!",

It is really delicious. The falafel tastes homemade,has lots of flavor, is nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It's one of the better falafel's I've had before. The place is quaint and seems clean. Always a good thing. The parking is all paid in this area, but there is a garage around the corner. I think these are going to be a new craving for me. :-P",

I travel for my job and ty every Greek restaurant within 10 or so miles of my destinations, and without question, the Kabob Place is the best. Everything is fresh (nothing frozen); all the sauces are made in house and are made that day; the pita break is baked in house and tastes like it just came out of the oven. Perhaps, most importantly, the owner has captured the essence of Greek hospitality. A person in my party had the salmon and described it as a religious experience. You must try the Kabob Place. Quite simply, it 's a game changer.. If you're from out of town, it will become a reason to come back to Santa Ana. If you're close by, you will be back!",

The food was exceptionally tasty- the seasoning, tenderness, and chargrilled flavor left nothinggggggg to be desired. We had a pretty good variety with the sampler appetizer platter and 2 entrees with chicken, koobideh and grilled vegetables. The salad was one of the best Ive ever received as a side from any mediterranean place. The produce was really high quality I could tell by its robust flavor and texture- which the dressing was just a nice accent really. The owner was very hospitable and the service was just right from a Pay at the counter type eatery. Thanks a bunch- we'll be back soon!",

The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws.

The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again. Staff were extremely friendly and inviting as well as helpful in menu selection. Bistro style inside, quaint and comfortable. We will be back, got a lot more menu to try!",

CustomerReviews: "If you don't eat a lot of Lebanese/Persian food, then the food seems good, but bad Persian food is still good. Compared to most places, the food is only okay. The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.",

CustomerReviews: "If you are looking for mediocre Mediterranean, then don't come here! This place is fantastic!!! Fresh, flavorful, locally sourced meats and veggies and house made sauces. As a family we eat low carb / Keto, so we are meat and veggie connoisseurs. The salmon, chicken, steak, gyro and hamburgers were all top notch! The portions are huge. The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated and the food was presented beautifully. We are visiting from out of state and have eaten at a couple of fine dining establishments that couldn't compare with the food we ate here. The owner / manager was so nice and accommodating.

I don't understand how a restaurant could allow themselves to get that disgusting. Don't you disinfect and sanitize the entire kitchen? Obviously not if the city has to come shut the establishment down because of such unhealthy working environment. Unfortunately the owner of the company the more mature lady was always rude and angry when approached. I try to make an order and she gave me a look of disgust.

Little shops that just give you good food.Walked up to the counter and grabbed a menu.  I had the chicken kebab platter.  The guy behind the counter who looked kind of like one of the bad guys from the Christopher Reeves Superman movie was super friendly.  Definitely not the bad guy.  He asked if I wanted half rice and half salad, which sounded perfect.  Grabbed a drink from the cooler, paid and we sat to wait for our food.  Another guy brought over a little something to chew on, which was good.  It didn't take long for the food to come by.  It was great.  So good.  The chicken had a little spice, but was perfect with the yogurt sauce they gave.I live nowhere near here, but if I was in the area, I would be there often.

CustomerReviews: "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.",

Sadly, the experience I had here was truly a disappointment and deterred from any of the positives I experienced.I visited this establishment during lunch time to grab a quick bite.  In the area that it's located, it was a super quiet street.  Everything is street parking with it being metered pay during the day.  It was very quiet for a lunch time with not too many people dining in.My biggest complaint was the service I received.  For the place not being so busy, it took forever for someone to take my order and then even longer for my food to come out.  The lady serving me was not very attentive and was very rude about everything.  She kind of threw my food on the table when she finally got it to me.  And when taking a peak back into the kitchen, everything done did not seem too sanitary.  The lady at the cash register was serving food in between taking orders and handing bills without washing her hands in between which I'm sure you're not suppose to do.On a positive note, they offer complimentary pita bread and a green herby dipping sauce which came out warm and delicious.  The gyro meat was decent, a little on the salty side.  It was a good portion sizing for one person.",

CustomerReviews: "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

Now onto the chicken, it's always super moist and delicious, definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate along with the basmati rice and their delicious salad. Last but not least the PITA bread!!!!

CustomerReviews: "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up!

I had lamb, koobideh (ground beef) and the chicken kebab and man was I pleasantly surprised. The seasoning from the meat to the salad and the sauces were really on point. I usually don't care for rice but this was buttery infused with saffron. Yum! Staff are super friendly, they're truly here because they want to be. I highly recommend stopping by if your in the downtown Santa Ana neighborhood. I can't wait to come back for more. Thanks guys!",

CustomerReviews: "The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.",

CustomerReviews: "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.",

CustomerReviews: "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.",

It is tiny shop closer to the Courthouse than the new renovations in DTSA, but worth trying if you are looking for Greek and Mediterranean food.  I wouldn't call it fusion, but they do step away from some of the traditional fare to cater to a more diverse set of tastes, but hey, that is what food in So Cal is all about.It definitely hit the spot for the day, and it is a place worth going back to again./",

CustomerReviews: "I would never have found this great Persian kabob place if not for the 2017 rendition of Savor Santa Ana. I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!",

The greek stoner fries with waffle fries, gyro meat, tzaziki sauce and feta were amazing.  We had the sultan plate with the chicken kebab, steak kebab, and kibbeh kebab.  Not a big fan of kibbeh in general, but my wife like it.  The steak kebab was good, but the chicken kebab was amazing, juicy, tender, and flavorful.  We tried a felafel appetizer as well which was also very good.  We will come back next time we are in the area.",

CustomerReviews: "We came in tonight just before closing. Usually not a good thing to do as the pickings can be slim and the quality unknown. Boy we're we wrong. It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight. We will be back.",

CustomerReviews: "I decided to come to Kebab Place based off of the location and the reviews. The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.",

CustomerReviews: "Service-poor.  I was the only one in line and it still took almost 10 minutes to place my order. Woman at the register was unfriendly,uncommunicative and barely spoke. When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad",

However, it was incredibly soggy already as the juices from the meat had permeated the wrapping. At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

CustomerReviews: "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.",

The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant.

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.",

Roc was very easy to work with and allowed me to customize my order that made sense for my event. Delivery was on time and most importantly, food was GREAT. Everyone complimented on the food and kept inquiring on where I ordered from. You won't be disappointed!",

CustomerReviews: "Great local eatery with fresh, flavorful ingredients and authentic menu with a little bit of American goodness. Food quality is excellent. I had the salmon salad with some pita on the side. The salmon had a crispy sear on the outside but soft on the inside, just delish.  The pita was really warm and soft. I could've made a meal out of the pita and assorted dips alone, it was that good. Restaurant was clean, food came out quick and the new owner was really nice and energetic. We were occasion visitors before but will definitely make it a regular thing. They have a really creative breakfast menu I'd like to try. See you there!!",

CustomerReviews: "Our new favorite Mediterranean place.Our first time in here and we were greeted by the friendly  owner who suggested we should try the sultan platter. We ordered 2 of the platter and substituted salmon on one. Food is so good. Flavorful. And the meat is very tender. Sauces are so good as well. Just as what we expected it to be. The naan bread is a hit. Overall was a great experience. Place is very clean and organized. We will definitely come back again soon.",

CustomerReviews: "I ordered the steak (filet mignon) wrap with fries. I wasn't a huge fan of the wrap but it wasn't bad. The fries were both crunchy and soft, which was perfect, but needed salt or seasoning. The sandwich cost about $14. I am probably going to go back and try another menu item. The restaurant advertises the food as halal. There  is a parking structure close by right across the street from the court house and max parking rate is $7",

CustomerReviews: "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!",

CustomerReviews: "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.",

On a cold evening, it was the perfect place to warm up and get a great meal!Location:  The restaurant is a little tough to spot because it's between stores.  It's worth the search!

Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

Prior to my arrival I phoned the establishment and spoke with Gita who was very sweet in taking down my order and provided some tips on keeping the food/dessert fresh out in the desert. Once I got to kebab place, I was greeted by Gita and a gentleman named Rock (owner) who was speaking very highly of the food and baklava. We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten.

CustomerReviews: "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.",

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty. But that was all.Totally a rip off, I won't go back.",

This place has the best kabob and salad dressing! Sometimes I just buy the hummus and the dressing then I cook at home. I know the place has lots of business during dinner so I can't understand why they would be closing early. Gida is so sweet. She is always gracious and helpful.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.",

It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalape\u00cc\u00c4\u00e5\u00b1o cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice. Well priced for the amount and quality of food Inside the place is small but clean. Would definitely go back again when in the area.",

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. Spot is great. Definitely coming back. The guys here do a top notch job. Supporting small places like this is a must. Try them out.",

It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less.

CustomerReviews: "What a gem! Thank you for coming to DTSA!I stepped out of my salon to have lunch and didn't want to frequent my usual spots Crave or Cafe Calacas (both are wonderful !) so I kept walking down 4th and walked past this spot but made a u-turn straight into this spot!I believe I met the owner who was very nice and charming. The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio. My clients will love the quality of freshness from this great spot!I will be back and I have been spreading the word so hopefully they are here to stay!",

I had the gyros wrap and it was amazing! It had so much meat on it and the meat had perfect flavor.  It was a large portion too.....I was really full afterward!Some of my lunch partners had the kabob plate and it was a kabob, rice, and salad and they said it was great too. We were able to walk here, order, eat, and make it back on time with 10 mins to spare. If you are in jury duty, I recommend walking here for lunch....it beats the court cafeteria by far!!

The chicken was marinated to perfection and was the best chicken I have had that I can recall.  The bed of saffron rice was delicious and the salad and the dressing was nice compliment to the rest of the food.  The stoner fries were a big hit and is definitely great as a shareable.

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good",

The seasoned fries are bomb ASF, super delicious, made as soon as you order! By far the greatest tasting food in DOWNTOWN! Great place, small but great for social gatherings. I visit almost daily .

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!",

CustomerReviews: "Wow! This is a truly authentic Greek restaurant. I travel for my job and ty every Greek restaurant within 10 or so miles of my destinations, and without question, the Kabob Place is the best. Everything is fresh (nothing frozen); all the sauces are made in house and are made that day; the pita break is baked in house and tastes like it just came out of the oven. Perhaps, most importantly, the owner has captured the essence of Greek hospitality. A person in my party had the salmon and described it as a religious experience. You must try the Kabob Place. Quite simply, it 's a game changer.. If you're from out of town, it will become a reason to come back to Santa Ana. If you're close by, you will be back!",

CustomerReviews: "OMG! SUCH A GREAT FIND. This place is so cute- right in DTSA on 4th street. The interior decor is so colorful and made me feel like I was at a little eatery somewhere in Turkey. The food was exceptionally tasty- the seasoning, tenderness, and chargrilled flavor left nothinggggggg to be desired. We had a pretty good variety with the sampler appetizer platter and 2 entrees with chicken, koobideh and grilled vegetables. The salad was one of the best Ive ever received as a side from any mediterranean place. The produce was really high quality I could tell by its robust flavor and texture- which the dressing was just a nice accent really. The owner was very hospitable and the service was just right from a Pay at the counter type eatery. Thanks a bunch- we'll be back soon!",

Literally could ring out the bread with grease. Returned with refund.2- Second sandwich, turkey club. Cashier girl forgot to tell the cooks to make it hot. They remade it, but again, grilled the turkey into a greasy mess.3- 2pm on a Sunday, took 30 minutes to get the sandwiches, from the time we got in line until they first gave us the order.

A club sandwich might sound plain to some, but the devil's in the details, and Bronx gets the details right. Fresh shredded lettuce, flavorful tomato, crispy bacon, rich havarti, loads of turkey, and a French rolls that's soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside... Perfection    100%",

    CustomerReviews: "After a night of too much tequila, not enough food and restless sleep on a friend's couch, I was ready for a monster of a meal to make me feel human again. I knew I wanted a breakfast sandwich so as soon as we walked in I locked in on the bacon, avocado, egg & cheese sandwich. My boyfriend was wavering between the philly cheesesteak and the pastrami reuben and finally settled on the latter. I got the breakfast sandwich on sourdough with pepperjack cheese and it came grilled, his was on toasted on rye. We were both confident in our decisions and eagerly awaited the buzz of our pager. When it finally came, we were both disappointed to say the least. The breakfast sandwich didn't look very appetizing, but since that's never really stopped me from eating a mass of chili cheese fries, I excitedly dove in...to my demise. The bread was slathered with so much mayo it was immediately all I could feel & taste, and I had to drown it in sriracha to remedy the sitauation. The sandwich was grilled, but never really got a good crust in any place so it all kind of mushed together. The worst part was that the bacon wasn't layered on the sandwich, but rather chopped into tiny bits and cooked into the egg, so you could barely taste it. My boyfriend's pastrami reuben tasted much better, but he had some issues because he felt the pastrami was more like corned beef, which was also a menu option for the reuben. We confirmed with the staff that it was in fact pastrami, but the thick cut, appearance and flavor of the meat still had him convinced otherwise. Having never had either meat, I couldn't offer an opinion but I do know that his sandwich was very tasty. The pickle it came with was also great and I ended up eating all of it instead of the second half of my sandwich. They also gave us two complimentary cookies which were delicious and buttery. They were less gooey than they appeared, but still so satisfyingly soft when you bit into them. Would I come back? The horrible feeling in my stomach all day after eating half the breakfast sandwich says no, but maybe I'd come back if I was feenin for a cold sub when in the area. One thing's for sure: I've definitely learned my lesson about the breakfast sandwiches and will head to DK's instead next time.",

    CustomerReviews: "After visiting Bronx today, I realized I never wrote a formal review... and you know I am all about a formal review! Gotta give Yelpers info they need to know!So here's the low down.Location: Bronx is located off Newport and Irvine in a little center. Parking is never an issue. Ambiance: The place is nice and clean. They play music and have a TV. There is ample indoor and outdoor seating. I always get our food to go, but I wouldn't mind eating my meal there. Over the last couple months, they have added a few upgrades and it makes the Bronx even better. It has never been really busy every time I have visited. I never wait in line for more than a minute or two. Staff: The staff is always nice and friendly. Today was the first time I encountered a different cashier. Not as perky as Tina, but still nice! If I am not given a number buzzer, they walk my food to me and something about that makes it personal and I appreciate it. Food: My oh my. As I said before in my previous review. Their sandwiches are delicious. I love sandwiches and honestly this is one of the best turkey sandwiches I have ever had. Their bread is so delicious that I want to eat it by itself. In my opinion I think the bread makes a sandwich. I think you know you have a good sandwich when you're willing to eat the bread alone. Their bread is fresh, soft, crunchy and chewy all at the same time. They pack on the meat and veggies giving you a huge sandwich. The sandwich is enough for 2 meals. Their sandwiches are made with high quality everything. They have a bigger menu every time I have visited and I can't wait to try all the new items. Oh and my favorite thing is that when you check in on yelp, you get a free bag of chips. And they're good chips - Zapps and Dirty Chips, not your normal lays or cheetos. All the sandwiches we have tried are delicious. And we ALWAYS get the Manhattan fries. My favorite sandwich is the yankee. Price: The price would be the only thing that I don't love about the Bronx. The sandwiches are all about $10. For 2 sandwiches and pastrami fries it is $30. It is a little bit pricey, but I honestly think it is worth the price. I don't mind paying for a clean establishment, great service and amazing food. It makes it all worth it. I cannot forget to mention the speed of their service. It's lightning fast. And you know me, I am always in a hurry and when boyfriend is hungry, he is hungry. I will literally grab my bag of chips, sit down, look at my phone and look back up and my food is ready. We'll continue going here forever because it is just that good. If only they would open one in the Inland Empire where I live... :P",

    CustomerReviews: "All hail the king of Tustin sandwich shops!The co-workers and I were looking for a new sandwich spot to try for lunch. After all, you can only eat at Togo's and Jersey Mike's so many times. When we discovered that Creation's Pizzeria closed and Bronx opened in its place, we had to go.I ordered #12 The New York. Roast beef, Havarti cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and mayo. Two things really stood out. First, the staff actually cuts the Dietz & Wasson meat when you order. This is highly preferable to pre-sliced meat held hostage in a storage container (e.g. Subway). Second, the sandwich was HUGE. Some sandwich shops load up on veggies to compensate for the lack of meat. Bronx piles on the meat like there's no tomorrow. For $8.99, I got a fresh, enormous sandwich loaded with thinly sliced meat. That's my kind of sandwich.The only downer was the slow service. There were maybe 3-4 customers ahead of us, but it took nearly 35 minutes to get our sandwiches. That really shouldn't happen at a sandwich shop. In any case, I'll give Bronx the benefit of the doubt since they just opened. Hopefully they'll work out this kink. We're definitely coming back!",

I got the chicken sandwich and the chicken was dry, bread was very wet from lettuce and there was an UNBELIEVABLE amount of mayo, don't get me wrong i love Mayo but this was Mayo dripping feel like there was more mayo than anything else. Also, checked in because they say they offer free fries with check in but NOPE they gave me chips WHAT THE HECK??? I would've bought fries if they would've told me they were gonna give me chips",

My daughter and I had the cheesesteaks and ahhhh, so good. Hot and huge. We should have shared one. Had to both take half home. But even better than the cheesesteak are their fries. Thin and crispy - McDonalds fries on steroids. Service is prompt and courteous. Time to table was under 10 minutes. Brought home a crumb cake which was sugary goodness later that night. Seating was not great, your typical hard chairs and basic tables. Diner style booths would be cool like you would expect back on the east coast but based on the few people actually eating there, I'm certain it's more grab and go than dine in.",

Within 10 minutes our order was in front of us as the waitress explained what had happened and then proceeded to tell us that lunch was on them.   Yes, they refunded our money in full and treated us to lunch.   We would have been happy with anything, yet they went above and beyond.   Great customer experience.

It was a small white worm crawling on the lettuce she was about to put in her mouth. Immediately we went back to Bronx where a   female employee tried to argue that it was a piece of cheese. Im sorry but the cheese I buy doesn't typically crawl around! Then another employee came over and stated that it was a fresh batch of lettuce and he doesn't know how the worms got there. At no point did they stop serving food to anyone and after a few minutes of blank stares they refunded her money. She was told a manager was unavailable that she could just email. We as a company eat at bronx all of the time and I can tell you the 30 plus people who work here will never eat there again.

    CustomerReviews: "BF and I tried Bronx for lunch over the weekend. I would have given them two stars, but I know they just opened, so I am hoping they can work out the kinks. Perhaps we will give them another chance in a couple months.I ordered #12, The New York, which is a roast beef sandwich. I paid $1.75 to add bacon and avocado to my sandwich, which brought the total to $10.74 for my sandwich. BF ordered #15, The Bronx Club, which is a turkey sandwich with the exact same ingredients as my sandwich, including the bacon & avocado, for only $8.99. He ordered his without tomato. I paid for lunch, the total for the two sandwiches with two bags of chips and two drinks was $30. Pricey.The whole ordering experience was irritating as the cashier wasn't paying attention at all, he kept asking us to repeat ourselves, and other staff kept talking to him and asking him questions while he was trying to take our order. I'm sure that is one of the reasons he couldn't maintain his attention span with us. We got our drinks and sat at a table. A few minutes later the cashier came over and told us that they ran out of roast beef the day before, so I needed to pick another meat. I went with turkey, which means I basically ordered the same sandwich as my BF, but I paid more because I had to add the items. Lame. Our sandwiches finally came out, and his had tomato, but didn't have bacon or avocado. So he had to send it back. While we waited for his sandwich to come back, I attempted to eat mine. There was way too much meat, I had to remove about half of it, as I am not a snake who can unhinge her jaw to eat a massive sandwich. I get that people probably like loads of meat, but half of mine ended up going in the trash, which is unfortunate. The sandwich was okay. I didn't think there was anything special to it, although I will say I liked the Havarti cheese a lot, it was very creamy. The sandwiches were too big for both of us, we should have split one, as we ended up taking two halves home. I just wasn't impressed with the entire experience, from the space cadet cashier, to the up-charge on a sandwich I couldn't actually have, to even being allowed to order an item they ran out of the previous day. Like I said, maybe we will try again, but for now, it's not worth the drive for me to go get a sandwich from here.",

    CustomerReviews: "Bronx is a very good sandwich place.   It is in a really cool little shopping center that looks like you are in Denmark or Holland.   I split a couple of sandwiches.   We ordered the Boss priced at $9.00 which is a take on an Italian sandwich with capocolla (spicy ham), salami, mortadella, provolone, mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, olive spread, italian dressing on a hero bun.   There is a very generous portion of meat and cheese as you can see from my photo.   And, the quality of the meat was high.   Also, the bread was very good, fresh and had a good bready taste.   Moreover, the olive spread was very good, with a nice olive flavor which complimented well the rest of the sandwich.   The sandwich was very good.   My only criticism with the sandwich was I was expecting a little more kick or spice with the meats which is typical of an Italian sandwich.   Still a great sandwich.Also, we ordered the Pastrami Reuben priced at $9.99 which was my favorite of the two.   The sandwich was stacked high with thick, juicy pastrami and came with swiss cheese, 1,000 island dressing, your choice of sauerkraut or cole slaw (we chose sauerkraut) on rye or hero (we chose rye).   The sandwich was huge; almost as big as a Katz deli type sandwich.   It was very flavorful with the sauerkraut, swiss cheese and 1,000 island.   I really enjoyed it.   Also, the rye bread was excellent.   The bread fell apart a little.   But, I am not complaining.   My only criticism with the sandwich was that the swiss cheese was not melted.   I expected that because the sandwich was advertised as a hot sandwich.   Nevertheless, it was a great sandwich.We also ordered some fries priced at $2.25.   They were unimpressive and McDonald's does better.   Bronx is one of the better sandwich places in Orange County.",

Normally I will get the club sandwich on a roll and it is always made well, the bacon is crispy and the sandwich stays together until the very end!

It was spicy like it said, the only part I didn't like was that it had fried jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os under the breaded chicken and they were soggy when I ate them :/ I think with breaded chicken I could just have regular jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os and be set.

Last week I spent almost 15 minutes on hold just to get hung up on (I'll upload a picture). And not an isolated incident. I order here a lot. And everytime I call I can barely hear what they're saying, and the attitude on the phone and in person always feels like you're bothering them and they just want you out as fast as possible.

    CustomerReviews: "Bronx Sandwich co is amazing. I got the sloppy bronx because I'm a sucker for spicy mayo and loved it. While it is a little overpriced, you don't regret it as the sandwiches are big enough to split between two people. We also got the Philly cheese steak fries which I thought were amazing. I really like that they have the touch screen magic fountain drink dispenser as it allows you to mix drinks and flavors. Their hand made potato chips are also pretty decent.I think the service could use a little work as they can be slow if it gets pretty packed. The slaw was also not the greatest in my sandwich and the fries are cut extremely small in my opinion. But the flavor and size of the food still makes the price worth it. I will definitely be back to try some of their pastrami sandwich options.",

The sandwich is large enough that it's basically two sandwiches. Everyone takes half home. The fries are really crisp - have an almost potato chip flavor to them. The sandwiches I've tried are Philly Cheesesteak and The Babe. The philly was really good - wish it had more cheese and less bread though. The babe comes with a lot of meat (high quality) but very little cheese and honestly was really bland. I will likely be back but it's not my top sandwich place.",

    CustomerReviews: "Came here on July 8, 2017 at around 12:00 with my friend after my event at Mitsubishi Owner's Day at Cypress. I decided to try out this new place after looking at the Orange County Hotlist of Cheap Eats Best of 2017, and Bronx Sandwich is ranked number one. The shop was busy and it was a hot, humid day. I wanted to sit inside. We got good timing as one of the tables was done being used. My friend got the East Coast Pastrami and I got the The New York with 2 fountain drinks for a grand total of $30.The sandwich is one of the best I had. The portion of meat they give on the sandwich is great. Also the veggies were fresh and generous. My friend liked his sandwich, he said it was very crunchy and crispy. Because I decided not to finish my food I got a to go bag to put the other half in. Even when I brought it back home (to San Diego, I ate it at 19:00 on a hot, humid day) the cold sandwich still taste almost like I had it there. I do not know how a New York deli sandwich exact taste like since I have not been there except when I was very young, but I can say that it is excellent for them to bring that kind of style of food here in SoCal.The drinking fountain had many selections. It was interesting that you can mix drinks. For example you can pick up to 3 flavors for the Mountain Dew energy. I picked lime, lemon, and strawberry. There was also vanilla and raspberry, which I did not try yet. You can do the same for some other selected drinks too. I did not order fries this, but it looks great on picture.The service here was great. The workers were patient to me ordering and attentive. The menu is organized very well, hot sandwiches on one side, cold on another and the french fries/other food on another one. However, I thought their interior was bigger because of the building on the right side of it appears to be connected to it. But, parking was easy to find, which is great for me who came from an hour of driving.Seriously, after eating here I had this thought to myself. Where have I been whenever I come up to Orange County from San Diego? I have driven plenty of times up to Orange County and to Los Angeles and I can not believe I never tried this place. The sandwich at Bronx beats Subways by miles, and is great when compared to Jersey Mike's. My friend says it is even better than our local sandwich shop. I was watching the promotional video of how they make the sandwiches. I can see the great quality control, the best ingredients, and great people who work for them. It is a hidden gem within Orange County that I never found out until today. Will definitely come back next time and order their fries as well and bring my other friends who missed out. This deserves a 5 star from me. It is also number one on my list for the most tasty sandwich I had this year and one of the best in Orange County.",

    CustomerReviews: "Catered a world class lunch from Bronx Sandwich yesterday.   The quality of the food clearly exceeded my expectations, clearly will be using this high end sandwich shop again.Ordered an Assorted Cold Sandwiches Platter (Small).   For $85.00 10 of us had a feast.   The sandwiches were all different.   They used exceptional sourdough French bread, fresh tasty meats/veggies/crab salad, and lovely condiments.   Each sandwich was well dressed and/or seasoned, perfect to pick up and enjoy.   Also ordered the Pear & Gorgonzola Salad (Small) which was enough for at least 12.   The salad included a huge vat of balsamic dressing, perfect for the crunchy walnuts, chicken and pears.   The salad was amazing.Also had their potato & egg salad, macaroni salad and an array of assorted chips.   For a business lunch for 10 the food I ordered worked out perfectly.   No question that I plan to use them over and over again.   Food of this quality is a challenge to come by.   And, their prices are beyond fair.Thank you for a wonderful lunch.",

It was our first time here, we decided to just go for it. Guys had the pastrami and cheese steak sandwich, I think. I had the grilled chicken, light on the sauce and no cheese or mayo. We all agreed the bread was the best part of the meal. The boys sandwiches had so much going on it was over kill and sloppy. My chicken was spongey and was processed, it didn't taste real. We also got fried to share. They were smothered and so little fries they were hard to find.   The guys that worked there were nice, place was nice. I guess we should have stopped another night when a healthier meal wasn't on our mind.",

    CustomerReviews: "Don't even bother.   This place has gone so downhill. We got four Baja chicken sandwiches from here today.   It was filled with ALL type of peppers instead of chicken.   I know because I took the sandwich apart to give my son some chicken.   I found literally two pieces of chicken in the entire sandwich; check out my photos.   This was after I finished one half of the sandwich, and noticed that there was no chicken but only jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os.   After I took out the sandwich stuffings, nothing but jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os and bell peppers showed up.   All four sandwiches turned out to be the same way.   If you want REAL sandwich, take your money and your business somewhere else.   Such a shame.   This used to be one of our favorite sandwich places.   Seems like it's doing pretty badly, and it should go out of business pretty soon for serving subpar food to its customers.   I won't ever be back.",

I also got the house chips - courtesy of Yelp check-in - Thank you.   Unfortunately they were rank.   The first couple I had were warm and delicious and then I got a rotten one, it tasted the like the oil was off or something.   I kept them for my husband to taste, just to make sure I wasn't being weird, but he also had a few and then hit a few rancid ones.   Don't know how that happens as I'm sure they are all cooked together in the same batch, but it did and totally put me off.   We threw them out.",

Not a big fan of small hard bread which I consider to be a bad sandwich trend where the consumer is the loser. Thank goodness you can order a pastrami on rye here. Not worth the price for the size of the sandwich tho. Too bad. I had high hopes for this place.Blue haired (literally) counter help asked if everything was OK in between her wiping counters and I said no and voiced my displeasure about the amount of meat on my sandwich (see photo). Then she asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said, \"no\" again. I get the feeling no amount of lip service I provide is going to fix the level of douchebaggery this place exhibits.I know what a real New York deli style sandwich is supposed to look like and this ain't it.",

    CustomerReviews: "Excellent Quality!!   My family loves French dip sandwiches, and we always would get them from XXXXX on Tustin Avenue.   We now have discovered Bronx, where they take the French Dip to a higher level.   First, the baguette they use for the sandwich is awesome, just enough texture, and it's great for soaking up the extra au jus.   The meat quality is what really sets this sandwich apart.   The meat is not loaded with fatty pieces like we would find at XXXXX.   And the taste is sublime with the provided au jus dipping juices.   The counter help is very friendly and attentive.   My son is crazy about their pastrami, and he's tough to please.All in all, if you want a above average sandwich, give this place a go.",

    CustomerReviews: "FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Had to try this place after seeing all the rave on Yelp. Arrived at 730pm on a Sunday (they close at 8pm) and was greeted by the staff before I was actually in the building (they pay attention to everyone approaching - nice touch). Right off the bat I noticed there were no menu boards to peruse so I approached the counter, saw several laminated menus and was offered assistance and recommendations (great service experience). Don't let the lack of menu boards frighten you, there is no rush, tri-fold menus are available if you wish to step back and ponder the options. This place is simple, just tables, chairs, and a the order counter with ample self seating indoors and out. The dinning rooms also sports a flat screen TV and seems neat, clean, and organized. The fountain machine is Coke branded (DP, Lemon Aid, Orange Fanta, Sprite, DC, and Coke); however, they also offer brewed Tea, Dr. Browns bottled drinks, beer (Stella), and wine (Copa). There is a condiment bar that provides the usual items and was well stocked. MY ORDER:I ordered the Bronx Club and a bag of chips which came to $11.08 with tax. I was offered choice of bread (several which I don't remember) but asked what they usually serve it on which was their baguette (I like to go original the first time around). Upon completing the order, I was handed a pager (like the blinking/vibrating type at sit down restaurants) and decided to look around and take a few pictures while I waited.My order was ready in 5-8 minutes, was bagged up nicely with sample size mac salad, slaw, peppers, and a pickle (not sure if this is normal), they were quite pleasant, eager to get my order to me at the late hour, thanked me for the visit, and hoped I enjoyed the sandwich. THE FOOD:The bag was seriously heavy! Upon getting home, I witnessed what everyone else finds when they unwrap their sandwiches...mass amounts of meat, cheese (piles of soft havarti WOW) and seriously fresh veggies. I had to come up with a plan of attack which was just to go for it and deal with it. While the baguette seemed a bit hard for my bite (it is meant to be like that) I enjoyed the texture and the taste (I think I will try a softer option next time). I powered through the sandwich and found I had not even touched my chips! I tried the Voodoo Heat which is not hot at all, the taste is more BBQ than anything else. As well, I tried the mac salad, coleslaw, pickle, and peppers. All   were very tasty. While I am not a big slaw fan, it was fresh, with nice crunch, tanginess, and flavor (I'd order that again).CONCLUSION:I was beyond full and very satisfied after finishing the sandwich which I feel could be split and shared by two people easily (seriously, the sandwiches are huge). I appreciated the fresh sliced meat as well as incredible bacon! I will be back to attempt other creations from the awesome team but will be careful to bring a solid appetite for sure. Thanks BRONZ Sandwich Co. team, the service was awesome, and I appreciated the kindness. My dining experience was stellar! *****",

Fries were good too. A little more dipping juice would have been the only thing we could have asked for.

    CustomerReviews: "For several weeks I've been stalking this place on Twitter to catch wind of an opening date. Last week I was finally able to come here during its soft opening while the remnants of that pizza place I never went to still hung on the walls. I was somewhat aware of what I should be expecting based on pictures they've been posting, and I readied my belly accordingly.I ordered the Sloppy Bronx because why wouldn't you, and after about 10 minutes I hauled it into my car and dragged it up to my office. An office isn't a super appropriate place to eat this thing - it's an abomination that requires patience and solitude. An hour later I woke up under my desk feeling fat and sassy. I spent the rest of the day in a stupor and vowed to take my wife as soon as I stopped feeling pregnant. Tonight we finally went again and I ordered the same thing, to split. There were slight differences between the two occasions.1. The restaurant is finished! And they have stuff to drink, like wine and beer!2. The first time I got the sloppy bronx, I got it on wheat. This time I got it on a baguette. The baguette was harder to fit in our mouths but held the sandwich better than wheat. Wheat is easier to eat at the beginning but falls apart more at the end - whereas the baguette was harder at the start but was more enjoyable as we ate it. I'll try it on rye next time.3. There were more fries on it this time, so I got a good handle on what they taste like (they are super good) and next time we're definitely going to order some street fries.4. They didn't have any printed menus last time, but they did this time, only they weren't by the door or anything so we didn't find them til after we ordered. They should find a stand to put them on by the front door. I'm gonna just add pics of the menu to help everyone out.Anyway, tl;drAre you hungry for a big meaty sandwich that'd make Dagwood blush? This is the place to go.",

    CustomerReviews: "For starters, the food always tastes awesome, I can't deny that. That being said... the service is not up to par. I've been coming here since this location opened and have seen a steady decline in service and consistency. I brought my boyfriend about a month ago and we had a great experience, but today not so much.First of all, the music was so loud the girl at the counter couldn't hear what either of us ordered and she was not personable at all. Our food came out quickly, I ordered a hot sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a cold one, but my sandwich came out first and sat on the counter for a good 5 minutes before the other one did. There was barely any cheese on my sandwich and NONE on my boyfriend's, which it said there was supposed to be. Also, my boyfriend had ordered, and paid $3 for, extra meat; if that was extra, then I hate to see what a regular portion is. Neither of us are ones to complain, but we spent almost $30 for two sandwiches and an order of fries, we just wanted what we paid for. I can deal with bad customer service as long as the food delivers and today it did not. Side note: the young lady working the counter had work out pants you could see her underwear through. Please at least address that.",

    CustomerReviews: "Found this place on Yelp & wanted to give it a whirl. Sandwich photos online were enticing. Arrived and it took F O R E V E R to even place my order. And I mean forever. Staff were so slow and didn't care. I stood there for 10min. It wasn't even busy. When I finally placed order I got a turkey sandwich (forgot the name) with fries. I went back to my car to wait. Came back in 10min and order still not done. Apparently my order got lost in the shuffle. No apologies from staff. So I waited some more. Finally get, and eat it at home and I was like MEH. Not completely horrible, but not great. Meat had a weird taste - or it was a sauce or something I didn't like. I thoroughly enjoyed my fries. Thank God for those. Prices are too high in my opinion. Doubtful I'd be back, I'd rather got to Togos or Ike's.",

Well, I got it and it was the BEST decision ever.   HUGE shrimp, perfectly crispy, just the right amount of other \"fixin's\" on it and the sauce was to die for!

    CustomerReviews: "Great food!   Customer service could be better though.   I had won a $20 gift card from an instagram contest early December and didn't have time until this past weekend to stop by and redeem it.   On the instagram accounts, there was no mention of the procedure or the expiration of this redemption.   Pretty much without a physical gift card, I, like anyone would, assumed you would just order at least $20 worth when you come in and get $20 off deducted.   Nope, the employees made it so complicated, and made me feel like I was bothering them.   It was not my fault they weren't prepared to handle this; I have email proof that I communicated to the owner to confirm it would be okay for me to come in this weekend.   The manager first said that normally they don't let you redeem it if you waited this long to come by, but they would honor it this time (golly gee willikers!   Thankya so much!!! *sarcasm*).   Then he created the gift card and was ready to hand it to me so I could get out of their way, and then told me I couldn't use a newly created gift card until the next day.   I was like, no, we drove an hour to come here and I am prepared to use it today.   Then it took a long time for them to figure out how to simply deduct the $20 I won off my order.   The employees looked so frustrated, the line got long and they wouldn't open another register, and I was just confused why they made it so complicated..   What else could I do but wait and hope they don't spit in my food later?Anyway, I loved the food here!   Here is what we got:1) The Boss - I normally eat cold sandwiches if it has a lot of Italian deli meat in it, and this was the perfect cold sandwich!   There were so many layers of meat in this and plenty of veggies.   It was like a whole balanced meal in one sandwich!   This has got to be my favorite sandwich from here and I would love to get this again!2) King of Queens - Lots of pastrami, corned beef, and mustard mayo, just the way I like it.   The meat in here, like in The Boss sandwich, was very fresh and I loved all the gooey melty cheese in it!   Enjoy this hot!3) Simply Just Fries - Lovely peppered fries!!   They were so hot and fresh.   If I were to come back again, I would try their other fry options for sure!",

    CustomerReviews: "Great lunch spot, but I recommend splitting your sandwich. The portions are huge! I've been to their Anaheim location, but never here. The parking is tricky because it's small lot and there's only two space options, one hour or thirty minute spots. This time around I tried the spicy fried chicken sandwich. A single thin chicken breast with lettuce, tomato and spicy mayo. Plus Sriracha sauce and fried jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os all on a soft French baguette. This is a great sandwich, crunchy and very flavorful, but I was missing the heat. This was surprisingly mild even with the sriracha and jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os. Like stated before this this was huge and very filling. I ate half and saved the rest for later. The bread was great, soft inside and chewy on top. The fries were ok, but most of the Philly cheese toppings were just on top and not really mixed throughout the fries. After a few servings, we were basically eating plain fries. Still tasty, but I want that Philly cheese all day! On my next visit, I'm getting the brisket fries with extra sauce!",

Their bread is freshly baked, the deli and cooked meats are on point, and the customer service is good. I've had the King of Queens on about 5 occasions and the Eggs/Avocado/Bacon/Cheese as well. Simply wow! They taste like something you would get at a corner store in the LES. They also have a multi-flavored soda machine. Now, they have a happy hour from 4-8 (M-F).",

The food can be a bit messy because the juices and sauces have a lot of time to saturate the bread while you work your way through the sandwich.Lost a star for how long it takes to get your sandwich. Sometimes it seems to take 10 minutes- not expecting Subway/Togo's time, but it could be faster.Parking is a challenge in this shopping center. If you go all the way through sometimes there are places in the back, but the main lot is always crowded.",

It is also VERY expensive.   I ordered the sloppy Bronx.   Don't get me wrong it is a good sandwich but just too much going on for me.   It was very frustrating to eat.   Second, as a new comer I wish the girl that took my order would have been a bit more informative.   I knew the sloppy had fries in it however I did not know it came with a heaping pile of fries on top.   Which means I could have skipped ordering a side of fries and saved $3 off of my $18.03 order! That's a pretty penny for lunch if you ask me.   This total was with a sandwich fries and a drink.   I'll give them another try as I am a sucker for a great sandwich spot!",

Once I sat down and realized that I had done that, I dreaded my sandwich, of course they were already making it so I can't change my order. But! Good news, I loved it! It tasted great, it was packed to the max, topped off with fries & cheese (I think) and it was beyond delicious! I personally chose baguette because I don't like rye or wheat bread. My brother got something else, I don't remember but with wheat and it looked delicious as well! They don't skimp on anything here. I used my check in to get a free bag of chips, yay! I got the Cajun ones, pretty yummy :) If you plan on coming here, come really hungry! If you're going to come here with a date or someone who you aren't unsure will totally finish their food, split the sandwich. My first half I had for lunch and my second half will be eaten probably for an early dinner lol! This place is great, decent amount of employees, neat and clean store.

At that time it was hard to justify a $10 sandwich for someone who will just nibble. My wife will get the Bronx Club and often share with my daughter, but even that was too much food (yeah, first world problems). What I have worked out, especially when we are not super hungry, is to have the sandwich cut in thirds and this has worked out beautifully. We have an opportunity to get a couple of sides, chips, drinks and one sandwich. This works out nicely as we get to enjoy the other flavors Bronx has to offer.Bottom line, great sandwiches.",

The hot and crispy fries are topped with grilled beef hot link, melted Swiss cheese, grilled bell pepper, onions and mustard, which make a perfect and satisfying combo.

I'm used to those big hunching sandwiches from the Stage or Carnegie delis in NY, and while, this place doesn't reach that sky high pile, they are very heavy.I like that the sandwiches are neat.  Mayo and Cheese (I added mustard.)People raved about the chips, and next time I'll grab a bag.   The ambience was good, and the service was quick for the noontime lunch rush.Parking is always a challenge in this center, but be patient and park around the back if you have to.

    CustomerReviews: "I guess I will just keep leaving sub-par reviews until management actually does something about their staff. After my visit this weekend, it honestly may be a while before I choose to come back. Once again, the story has changed about sides. Now you get nothing but bad service to accompany your $10 sandwich. Oh and a pickle...but only IF you're smart enough to ask for one. I'd advise not even bothering to ask the staff questions about their food, because they have NO clue what's going on. You have to know to ask for a different bread if you want anything but a roll. You have to know to ask for a side, if you want anything but a sandwich. You have to know to ask for a pickle. And heaven forbid you don't know this and ask after you've already ordered, the staff treats you like YOU are the stupid one for not knowing. This time around we ordered a Philly Cheesesteak & a Bronx Club, to go of course (please see prev reviews). Both sandwiches barely had any meat. Like, if I hadn't stopped to look for the meat, I would have completely missed it. Might I also mention Philly CheeseSTEAK. The name of the meat is IN the name of the sandwich. I paid for extra cheese on the Philly; which apparently paying for more of one thing equals getting less of another?? On the club however, they were not shy about piling on heavy mayo & lettuce. So what I got for $20 + tax was 2 sandwiches (ONLY, no sides at all, not even a drink) with hardly any meat & bread so soaked through with condiments it's practically inedible.   I just don't understand how a place can charge $8-$10/sandwich and then completely short their customers...on food quality AND service. It seems like their staff is no more trained on daily procedures & customer service as they were the last time I spent $$ at Bronx. Every time I have visited Bronx, I have noticed that it is completely dead in there. Maybe that's a sign. All I know is that I've now dined at Bronx easily half a dozen times & the service/quality of product continues to nose dive. HEY MANAGEMENT and OWNERS--Take a hint from your customers that care enough to let you know there's a problem...and FIX IT. I really was a huge fan of this place; however now they are one more bad sandwich/bad experience from losing this customer, that's for sure.",

Afterall, it was Salami Day - so I needed some salami in my lunch.   I was with two friends, so I also ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Fries for all of us to share.   They looked delicious... and maybe the fries started out crispy but they were soggy once you really got to them.   There is a TON piled on top of them, so I get it.   I dont like green or red peppers on my cheesesteaks so I didnt love the fries, as I feel peppers over power any other flavor on any food.   Back to The Boss.... I asked for no tomatoes, and I asked to sub the cheese out to Swiss.   A comment was made that my sandwich looked like the light version, as there wasnt a huge stack of meat... and Ive noticed others mentioning in their reviews it seems they have started to skimp on the meat.   I ended up only eating half of my sandwich, and about half way through, I took off the lower layer of bread, because there was just too much   olive spread. It was good, it was just a lot.I went back and got three cookies, and the cookies were pretty good.   Soft, but could have used a bit more flavor.My lunch, was $25, then another $10 for the cookies... WAY too much money for what I had, in my opinion.   I saved the second half of my sandwich, but it had leaked (oil Im assuming) so much that it was not edible.   The staff was friendly enough, but really not too into it.

    CustomerReviews: "I literally felt the obligation to write this place a 5 stars review right after I finished my lunch sandwich. OMG the veggie sandwich I got from here was the best veggie sandwich I've ever had, if not the best sandwich, to the point I ended up eating a whole thing in 1 go all by myself (I'm very small and also a picky eater). The sandwich itself was huge to me, and I got it in lecture wrap along with lots of mayonnaise/siracha. I took one bite and i swear if heaven was to be real, it'd probably taste like this. Every single ingredient was perfectly cooked, not to mention how fresh everything was. The lettuce wrap made my sandwich a little messy, but that just gave me some left overs on my fingers to lick at the end.I should've taken some pictures before I dig in but the smell contaminated my soul and I'm 100% down to go straight to hell with my delicious veggie sandwich.",

    CustomerReviews: "I live in North Tustin and go the Bronx a couple of times a month. This place is interesting, they make some of the best sandwiches I've every had yet they service is probably the worst I've experienced. It isn't an issue of catching an employee on a bad night, it is systemic. They are rude, make mistakes nearly 100% of the time and generally just don't care about their customers. It's like they are annoyed you're there. It is a testament to the quality of their food that I go back all the time but be prepared for authentic New York customer service.",

    CustomerReviews: "I love me a good sandwich, and this place is a solid four stars. People are complaining about the prices - but just look at the pictures. You can see that they pile on the meat here, if you want a $5 footlong from subway where you can't even see the meat inside, go for it. Anywho, I stuck with a King of Queens sandwich on a baguette (bread recommendation from the nice cashier). I also got a small side of the seafood salad thanks to my yelp check in offer. The sandwich was awesome, I'm not even a fan of mustard but everything on that sandwich just worked well together. My bill ended up being around $10 or so, but I could barely finish half the sandwich. I saved the other half for dinner but the sandwiches here are so big that I think two people could just share one and be happy. The seafood salad was disappointing though, the pieces of fake crab inside were chunky and just had a very unappealing chalk like taste. I wouldn't recommend it, but I can't really complain about it since it was free. My friend got the sandwich of the day, which was some crazy pastrami sandwich with 10000 different things with an egg. We both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches. Service was also quick (got both sandwiches in under 5 minutes). I can't wait to come back and try their other sandwiches!",

    CustomerReviews: "I love the Bronx Sandwich Co! I've been to many sandwich shops and I'm going to tell you the Bronx makes excellent sandwiches. With names like, The Boss, Mob, Hero, Babe, Sloppy, King of Queens, and so on....you better live up to those names...and they do.One of my favorites is the Boss. It's packed with all the Italian classics but, what makes it awesome is that chunky olive dressing....mmmmmm....it is the perfect addition to any sandwich. Not only does it taste amazing but the portions--this thing is beyond the size of your tummy. I always end up finishing it but, man...am I full and happy. They also seemed to have added a bunch more sandwiches including the shrimp po boy, fish n chips, baja chicken, and so many more.They also have a wonderful selection of chips, cookies...and a few others, I can't seem to remember at the moment.Although, my only complaint would be the fountain drink dispenser. It's one of those fancy single units with so many options. It's cool looking but, the process to get a drink is slow with way too many options. I've seen a line for it and it's not pretty. Oh, and there's even draft beers...it's too bad it's a popular lunch spot, and unfortunately, beer is not an option.",

    CustomerReviews: "I love this place! After the first time I tried this place, I came here 5x in 2 weeks. The best sandwiches I've had in the OC. Great quality meat and bread. Restaurant is nice and clean, but not too formal. It has indoor and outdoor seating.So far I have tried:The mobster: amazing! This one is pastrami and turkey on a baguette. The meats are great quality and blend perfectly together and the bread tastes nice and fresh. The only thing I did differently ordering it after the first time was adding pickles.Pastrami Reuban: the pastrami is delicious and I'm not a big fan of thousand island dressing usually, but this one is delicious and compliments the sandwich perfectly.Shrimp po'boy was so popular they started offering it everyday. Breaded shrimp served on a baguette with a side of red spicy sauce. Breaking doesn't have too much flavoring on it. The spicy sauce on the sauce really makes it for me. I've had better shrimp po'boy sat Cajun spots, but for just your local sandwich spot it's pretty darn good.Good pastries such as black and white, and brownies available at the register, definitely yummy!",

    CustomerReviews: "I love this place.   We had sandwiches this weekend and while they are pricey ($9 to 11 each), they give you a huge sandwich with plenty of great tasting meat.   (And often you eat half the sandwich and save the rest for later.)   The rolls are wonderful - I understand they do a final baking at the store.   Amazing! I've been a big fan since they arrived in Tustin and they continue to stay great.   They're in a location that has seen a large turnover of restaurants over the years and I'm thrilled they continue to do well - even without advertising to the local neighborhoods.If you've never been - go!

A strange thing observed on both my and my colleague's sandwich is the meat distribution is really uneven, one half of the sandwich has a lot more meat than the other.   This is strange because it happened on 2 of the 4 sandwiches that we ordered.4 of us went for lunch yesterday and only one of us thought the sandwich was good (we got all 4 different sandwiches).

    CustomerReviews: "I really love a good sandwich, and this place makes great ones! Came in the for the first time tonight and ordered the pastrami reuben, the boss, and the philly cheese steak fries.Let's start with the pastrami reuben...it was delicious! The pastrami was thick cut, peppered slabs, and so tender. It had the perfect amount of sauerkraut, 1000 island, and cheese. No one flavor took over the other- they all just worked together. The rye bread was so soft and fresh. Each bite was packed with flavor, and I couldn't stop eating it. My only complaint is that this sandwich could have used a little more pastrami haha! The Boss was just ok. This sandwich had a ton of meat on it, but not a lot of flavor. Most of the flavor came from the olive spread, which I didn't really care for. The salamis and meats added no kick so that was disappointing. The baguette was a little tough as well. Would not order again.The Philly cheesesteak fries were really good! They were loaded with cheese and meat. Definitely worth the $8. My only complaint is that the fries got soggy after about 5 min because of all the toppings. But I would still order them again. Overall, the portions are huge, and the sandwiches and fries are really good. I definitely want to come back to try more of their hot pastrami ones, because it seems like that's where they excel!",

The pastrami was overall very good, but had a little processed tasted, like they bought it from another vendor. Which I am sure was the case.

The coleslaw was the right flavor to add a bit of sweetness, but not distract from the meat flavor. The thick melty cheese was a rare treat I haven't seen in a while.

I didn't fully read the ingredients for the Boss as I would have left the olive spread off of it but it was just a light spread so it wasn't too overwhelming (I am just not a fan of olives) This is definitely on the regular rotation.

This basically means piling on a whole lot of meat between freshly made bread.   I ordered at the front register and decided to go with the Mobster.Mobster ($10.49) -   The mobster consisted of of half pastrami and half golden turkey, American cheese and mayo all served on a freshly made French baguette.   They definitely didn't skimp on the meat in the sandwich and everything went well together.   The meats were tender but didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for.   The French baguette held everything in place pretty well and tasted all right.   It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Overall the sandwich tasted pretty good and with a YELP check-in my order came with some house potato chips.

Overall I was disappointed in the sandwich for the price.The Good - the pastrami was excellent.   Portion was large.The Bad - the cheese was overpowering the good pastrami.   My mistake in not getting the East Coast Pastrami which looked to just be pastrami.  The French Baguette was too big for the amount of meat and I had a lot of bread left over.   I love my French Baguettes crunchy for eating with cheeses or for using for dipping with Vietnamese soups / stews.   But for eating a sandwich the toughness got to be a little annoying and a little painful.   I really wished the bread were softer.   The sandwich was pricey too.   I definitely enjoy a good Togo's Pastrami more than I enjoyed this Pastrami and it is cheaper and much easier to eat (softer bread).All in all - there are a lot of choices on the menu and I'm sure there are some great sandwiches.   But not sure I'll be back - too pricey to take my chances.",

    CustomerReviews: "I was here on November 24, 2017 at around 11:30 with 2 of my friends. I brought a new friend to try out this place. We also happened to come at a good time as there was no one in the restaurant eating or in the parking lot since it was Black Friday. We happened to be in the area since we ourselves were Black Friday shopping too.To update my review, I still ordered the same sandwich, I believe the Bronx club and I enjoyed eating every bite of it. There were lots of vegetables and meat on the sandwich. My mouth can barely even fit. The price is reasonable for the sandwich(around $10-15 depending on what type of sandwich you get). The sandwich is also filling too, both times I have been here and I never finished it. The cold sandwich last long enough for my dinner. The fries that my friend ordered were delicious. I wanted to keep eating, but I had to hold back as I was full. That day I was not in the mood to eat a big meal due to lack of sleep and black Friday shopping. Everything we used in the lobby was clean and I am very thankful we came at a time where there was no one there. But normally this place is busy and parking at times could be hard to find.My friend that came with me this trip loved it. He says it is one of the best sandwiches he ever had. He will definitely be thinking about this place with his group of friends that loves to come up. There is one more friend that I will be bringing sometime in January because he loves sandwiches and I think he will like it over Jersey Mike's (his current favorite sandwich shop). I just never got the chance to bring him up because of the school semester we had together in class, but I do owe him one and this is the place he's been begging me to take him to since my 2 friends who came with me loved it more than Jersey Mike's. So expect an updated review again with me throwing his opinions in it next year (January-February 2018). As for my opinion, it deserves a 5/5 stars and many more visits next year whenever I visit OC and LA.",

    CustomerReviews: "I went because of the steller reviews and I was a bit disappointed. I had the messy Bronx and The New Yorker. The Bronx was a bit salty and didn't taste really that good as everything tasted muddled but the New Yorker was fine if you get the pickles which are free but if you don't then it doesn't taste any better then your typical sandwich.   The bread to filling ratio is way off as I got the baguette on both and it was way to much bread.   When I went back to get my pickles the rep gave me an annoyed look so customer service is a zero but since he looked like a teenager I can't knock a star for that reason.   The cost for the sandwich didn't seem reasonable for what you expect to receive so I probably only recommend a one time visit.",

The first thing I noticed right off the bat was how extensive the menu was. Aside from sandwiches, there are also salads available. Since I am currently on a diet, I opted to be safe and order the grilled chicken sandwich. It was piled high, but orderly, with chicken, Provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and mustard. I am sure I missed something.The sandwich was huge. Bug enough for 2 meals. A great value for $10.00. The staff was friendly, but parking can be a little tricky.",

    CustomerReviews: "I went with my GF and this place exceeded my expectations. My family visited this place recently and recommended it to me. Because I can always go for a good sandwich. It's located in Old Town Tustin in the same parking lot as Tustin Brewery. I ordered the $11.49 Sloppy Bronx (thinly sliced beef, all beef hot link, melted American, Swiss, & pepper jack cheese, crispy fries, coleslaw, yellow mustard and spicy mayo) The Sandwich came out and it was HUGE. Definitely more than enough to split. I tried to conquer it and I failed. I ate half and took the other half home. It was really good, it had a lot of different flavors, that I very much enjoyed. My GF ordered the $10.99 Zesty Lime Chicken Salad (mixed greens, chicken, avocado, pepper jack cheese, roasted peppers, tomatoes, sweet corn, toasted pumpkin seeds served with cilantro-lime dressing) she said it was good but it had a very intense flavor but she would order again in the future. Overall I really liked this place. I will definitely be back in the future, but next time most likely will split one of there GINORMOUS sandwiches.",

    CustomerReviews: "I will start this off by saying I feel very conflicted in my rating of this place. I've been here several times and have always gotten the Philly cheese steak sandwich, which is absolutely delicious. The fries are great too. If I were rating on taste only, it'd be five stars.The reason my rating is so low is because my boyfriend and I both got horrible food poisoning the last time we ate here. We both ordered the Philly cheese (we each got two so we could save one for lunch the next day). We both missed work for the next two days, I had to cancel a business trip the day of my flight, and we had to throw out the extra sandwiches we ordered. When we called to let them know we got food poisoning from their food and ask for a refund, whoever answered the phone just took down a phone number and told us the manager would call us back. No one ever called us back.I really loved the food here and would have been able to eventually come again had they at least called us back, but because no one has contacted us to even apologize, I will not be patronizing this business again.",

    CustomerReviews: "I'll be honest, I'm not a huge sandwich person, but Bronx sandwiches are pretty damn good. They have a host of cold and hot sandwiches, all substantial in size. Whenever I drop by, I know I'll be fed for at least two meals, and that's not counting the complimentary chips you get with your check-in!My favorites from Bronx include the Boss and the West Coast Pastrami. Next up, I'll likely try the pastrami reuben with a fried egg and one of the po'boy options, which they always seem to be out of when I drop by. I should also try the loaded fries option - while I've not had them here, they never fail to look delicious, and I'm a sucker for cheesy, meaty fries. I'll also note that Bronx Sandwich is in a great location. Whenever I drop by here, I find my way to Tustin Brewery to refill a growler or two. Tustin Brewery has some great options, and the refreshing beer plus the yummy, hefty sandwich makes for a great casual meal with the buddies at home.",

    CustomerReviews: "I'm just not passionate about a sandwich.   I know some people are.   Maybe it's because it's one of those foods where it's so easy to get away with mediocrity.   It's really hard to hide sub-par fish.   Or weak mashed potatoes.   But a lackluster sandwich??- that's just what sandwiches do.   When you decide to get a sandwich it's like you're already resigning yourself to middle-of-the-road mere satisfaction.   You're giving up.   Like that time I wore Crocs to work.   I stopped trying.   But that's not BRONX Sandwich Co.   They definitely haven't given up.What does it take to be an Awesome Sandwich?   Warm, toasty bread/rolls.   Cold cuts with actual flavor and not just a generic processed saltiness and slimy texture.   Fresh fixin's and veggies.   Generous servings.   And maybe a little something extra.   BRONX checks all the boxes.   I ordered The Boss, because I was craving an Italian sort of sub.   This is definitely their version of an Italian sub.   Their mortadella and capocola were to die for.   Even though I didn't order a toasted sub, the bread was so fresh it was warm in my hands when I unwrapped the paper wrap.   The rest of the sandwich was cold and crisp, like it should be- but what a treat to have actual fresh-baked-bread.   The something extra?   The Boss sandwich has a spread of olive tapenade on it.   They seasoned it with just the right amount of Italian dressed.   Nothing was soggy or overwhelming.   Just perfect.   What were the other extra things that made me super happy at this place?   Salt and Vinegar kettle chips.   Finely shredded lettuce.   A pickle spear on the side that tastes like a New York deli.   And they ship-in black and white cookies and chocolate macaroons from New York for dessert.   All of the staff was super friendly and helpful- which come to think of is, was probably the least \"New York\" part of the place.",

They have so many options to choose from; I was overwhelmed. I like how they bring the east coast to the west coast with the types of sandwiches that they have!We ordered the Bronx Club and Turkey Salad sandwich with their house chips. Let me just say, they stack these sandwiches thick! You're definitely getting your money's worth here. The Bronx Club was amazing, especially because their turkey is so fresh!! My father got the Turkey Salad sandwich, and he ate all of it in one sitting! I was excited to see that they have house chips that are made fresh to order. They were perfectly crispy and tasted even better knowing that they were made in-house. They also have street fries that I want to try next time!Their sandwiches are huge, so I just wish that they had half sandwiches available. I couldn't finish my own sandwich and was able to take it home. I'll be back to try more sandwiches! :)",

The second time I tried the Bronx club cold sandwich ($9). This comes with turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, and mayo. Between the two the Sloppy Bronx is better, but it's also less healthy which could be why it tasted better ;) It's a order and pickup at the counter type joint. They give you buzzers so you can claim a seat instead of waiting near the pickup area. There always seems to be a wait when I go, ~10-15 min. You have to wait in line to order then wait for your food to be prepared. The food is worth it though. The sandwiches are between $8-$10. If you get the baguette the sandwich is probably around 12 inches. They load the sandwiches up full of meat and ingredients.",

I have tried 6 of their sandwiches and so far I still like their pastrami and corned beef sandwich the best (can't think of the name just this minute). They use real cheese on their street fries, not nacho cheese (Yuck!), so that's a plus. I LOVE salty foods, so the pastrami fries were perfect for me. I do wish that the store was in a better location (small and parking sucks) though. Also, sometimes the workers give off this air of \"I don't want to be here\".

I know it's supposed to be high quality deli meat and maybe it's just the amount of sodium....but I always feel crappy after I eat a sandwich from Bronx.

What I got was maybe 5-6 slices of pastrami and 60% chopped lettuce. It was still tasty and filling, but it didn't really satisfy my craving for meat.Service was quick and staff was friendly, overall a nice experience, just don't expect the towering meat for a reasonable price.",

I came in at 13:15 and ordered #8 pastrami sandwich no cheese.It was a take out order because I had to go wait for my son to get out of school. I get my order $14 with a small drink. I get to school park and am looking forward to a great sandwich, no such luck, it had cheese on it and the pastrami had so much fat on it was visually gross and I like pastrami. The sandwich was dripping with grease and as much as I was looking forward to blowing all of my calories for the day in one meal, I just couldn't do it. Too much dressing too much fat on the meat too much cheese, you would need a spoon to eat that sandwich.So maybe they have other sandwiches that are good I will never know I threw the sandwich away and didn't see a point to calling about it because the staff working there was the same staff that wrapped up that greasy mess and charged me $11 for it.",

It was pretty empty on a Tuesday evening, but reading the reviews I was in the mood for a good old fashioned sandwich.   BRONX did not disappoint.Service was just ok, the cashier didn't seem very pleased to be there, and if you want pickle wedges you have to ask for it.   Also, check in on Yelp and get a free bag of chips.   The food came out quick, I was getting it for take out.   The sandwiches are huge, packed with plenty of meat and dressings.   The Boss is your typical Italian hoagie, very fair priced at $10 and could feed you for 2 meals.   The King of Queens also $10 gives you both Pastrami and Corned Beef with melted Swiss Cheese and some good mustard.   The portions are more than fair and the taste is delicious.   Their cuts of meat are good quality, the sandwiches taste fresh.   Very filling, very satisified.I'm definitely coming back here whenever I crave a good hoagie.   Come check this place out.   The 4 stars out of 5 is just due to the service being ok and even when I asked for pickle, I still didn't get it, they must have forgot.",

I've been working my way down the menu and have rarely been disappointed.Today was the Philly Cheese   (provolone and American) with grilled onions and mushrooms.   I had them hold the peppers today, and their tendency to include mayo on almost everything is a factor in usually skip. Really, mayo has no business on a cheese steak.That said, the hero of their sandwiches are the French baguette rolls they use.   So soft on the inside, crusty on the outside.   Perfect.

Before I left to head over to Bronx I looked a reviews with a customer saying breakfast sandwich but forgot avocado. Well I had unfortunately the same issue. My wife got Italian dressing in the side and ranch but yet nothing was in our bag. My bad for not checking. However, I am more upset at how I was treated going back in and asking for what should have been in my order the first time. Felt attitude, there was no apology. This was at 630pm on Friday the 17th of November. Then had the nerve after driving all the way back over to give me a tiny amount of Italian dressing and when I asked for more questioned me. Over ITALIAN DRESSING!! No apology of making me make 2 trips. Hopefully the owner looks at these reviews and can look back and know who was working. The food was bomb but based on that service I won't go back and give my hard earned money to a business who has no respect for its customers time. Very unfortunate this kid is the first impression of this business. 1/7/18- gave this business a second chance and since my return it has been consistently better. Thank you for the improvements.",

The sandwhich was served on a chewy baguette with lots of beef, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and two types of melted cheese. I skipped the mayo which turned out to be a good decision because the cheeses were more than enough to add creaminess to the sandwich. It came out pipping hot, and delicious. The fries were also amazing - it reminded me of a more delicious version of the In & Out fries ordered well. Every fry was super crispy even when it got cold.

We finally made it on a rainy day a week ago.By the pictures we viewed we knew the sandwiches were going to be huge.   We were not disappointed! She had the Sloppy Bronx, which had sliced beef, hot links, three different cheeses (which she loved), cole slaw, French fries (which she thought was a little much), and chipotle mayo (which she said made the sandwich).   I had the King of Queens, which had very THICK cut hot pastrami and corned beef, Swiss cheese and mustard. I have never seen that thick of cut meats on a French roll!   Then, we really did not need it, but we went a little overboard, and had the Street Fries (which could have been a meal in itself).   We decided on the Alabama Fries, which had the hot links, jack cheese, peppers and jalapenos, on top of fries with spicy mayo!   I had most of them, as they were similar to the sandwich she had.

The bread had excellent crunch while being soft inside. It held up well to the au jus and moist meat.   My husband tried the corned beef Reuben and said that the bread was really, really dry so it ruined the sandwich for him. Good amount of meat and coleslaw on the sandwich but he couldn't get past how dry the bread was. Maybe if it had been toasted then slathered with the dressing it would have been better?

The first time I ordered from Bronx the sandwich was like those in the pictures... However, the last couple of times we picked up a sandwich the service and food has been immensely disappointing... Food we pay a premium for - $10 should guarantee a Giant sandwich. Broz earned themselves my first Three Strike review:- Time before last they didn't wrap the sandwich properly and it practically fell apart and they forgot the pickles. Plus I noticed they out less meat!- Last time, they didn't wrap the pickles and the juice got all over my girlfriend and my car. Not as much meat as the first time... Bait and Switch?- This time they really skimped on the meat (supposedly they weigh the meat) and tried to make it look thick by stuffing the middle.... A truly pathetic sandwich. I say Rip Off! The manager/owner was even there watching this tea sandwich being made...When you're hungry and looking forward to a nice big sandwich and you end up with bread with a tiny bit of meat and some avocado smeared across, you're going to be disappointed...

They had a selection of cookies in plastic wrap on the counter and I grabbed a chocolate chip. I was given a pager and stopped at the freestyle soda machine before sitting at one of the many tables inside.The wait was less than five minutes.This was a basic, no frills pastrami, piled high between two slices of rye with mustard as the only condiment. The thick slices of pastrami were velvety tender and the flavor was robust - perfectly done so that you closed your eyes with pleasure as you savored it. The rye was very fresh and perhaps a bit too delicate to handle the vast amount of meat. In true deli fashion, a long slice of pickle was on the plate to enjoy after the sandwich. I highly recommend the choice of east coast pastrami.The cookie was excellent too. Huge chocolate chips filled the thick, fresh cookie. It was a nice way to finish the meal.",

I don't even think they put salt n pepper on em. They have NO FLAVOR. The bread is great if you don't want your sandwich to stay together and or you hate your mouth. You do get some added value from the weeks supply of lettuce they pack into the sandwich.   They clearly get the lettuce in bulk from Costco and gotta offload it on your wich. You got places like Claro's down the street and can get a better sandwich for less money. You even got chains on the same street that have a better sandwich at a better price and also have ACTUAL FLAVOR.Staff and service is really good.

    CustomerReviews: "Really glad I finally came across this meaty sandwich palace. There's was basically no wait on a weeknight, but some of the parking near the restaurant was about 30min.Pros:++ Brisket Sandwich was the sandwich of the day and it was stuffed with meat, cheese and onion. The brisket was juicy! Definitely a good sized portion to get you full. I'd say at least twice the meat compared to a Subway or Togo's.++ Philly Cheese Steak Fries were pretty amazing also. Imagine a philly cheese steak, but instead of bread they use thin, crisp fries. Ohyeaaa.+ Free chips with check in and they have a pretty good selection including voodoo chips from new orleans.+ They had horseradish and spicy mustard available which made the sandwiches that much better.Cons:+/- The container the fries were in was a little scalding when I first got it, so watch out.- The maui onion chips they had were nothing like the Hawaiin kettle chips which let me down just a little. Tasted like plain chips to me.Overall, this is a great sandwich place for around ~$9 where you definitely get a meal worth of protein.",

    CustomerReviews: "Really good pastrami, corned beef and brisket sandwiches.   The prices may seem a bit high but once you see the large portions you understand why.   I like the sourdough and rye bread they use, but I'm not fond of their baguette.   It's too dense and hard so when you take a bite, all the filling slides out.   This is where the real French or Vietnamese style baguette is far superior because it's lightly crunchy on the outside but soft and airy on the inside, thus holding the fillings together much better.   I think a slightly softer roll would work better instead of their current baguette.",

    CustomerReviews: "Riding my bike through the new neighborhood, Old Town Tustin, I suddenly felt the need to eat lunch, and a good sandwich at that. Being a fan of Bay Cities Italian Deli, in Santa Monica, and also down the street from my last job, I needed something worth it. Enter Bronx Sandwich Company. I was pleasantly surprised with this new-to-me sandwich shop. When I walked in I was the only customer, but their massive chip and glass bottled soda inventory kept me intrigued. My choice was the The New York, which is a roast beef, havarti, lettuce, tomato, mayo, (hold the onions and add spicy brown mustard please) sandwich. I chose the french baguette. This was such a great sandwich, I can't wait to go back and get it again. One of the biggest factors for me, personally, is the bread. They get a 3.5/5 from me. The bread wasn't amazing, but it wasn't stale. It had a nice tenderness that was not too chewy. Better than Subway or Quizno's i.e., but not nearly close to Bay Cities Italian Deli (and well, is anything, really?). Pros: no linegreat chip and bottled soda/root beer/actual beer collectionpretty decent breadlots of hot AND cold sandwich combinationsfancy soda machine I didn't use, but it looked so cool I almost got one just to try itsuper friendly servicecons: kinda expensive for a (what I think is a chain?) sandwich at $11. That's bay cities prices, yo.overall, I'm a fan. I'll happily bike or drive back here for another sandwich.",

The plaza that it's located in is quiet, but nicely illuminated at night and BRONX stood out to me in the corner. Parking is a little tight if the area is busy. Very spacious dining quarters; seating is spread out and plenty of patio space as well. They have a long list of sandwiches! Most of which are named as New York tributes: The Babe, The Yankee, The Bronx Club, etc. After speaking to the staff about menu recommendations (I really wanted to try everything after reading the ingredient list) I settled on the #8 (Pastrami Reuben w/slaw on marble rye). I normally love kraut, but they pointed out the sweet element of adding slaw instead. I was not disappointed when served a thick pastrami sandwich that was neatly stacked--definitely a reminder of those East Coast deli delights. So big, I boxed the other half for lunch the next day.

    CustomerReviews: "So I went here again because I wanted to give them another chance.   Long story short it was a bad food experience that I had to throw half the sandwich away.   I had the king of queens on a baguette (hot pastrami and corned beef with swiss and spicy mustard) and my friend had a cold sandwich which he said was ok but no better then any other sandwich place, just expensive.1.   Overly salty.   I had to go to the soda fountain 3 times, 2 times soda, and the final visit water to eat half the sandwich.   I opened the sandwich to see why it was so salty and saw that the spicy mustard was only smeared on the last bit of the baguette which I took a bite and it tasted better but since they only smeared literally the tip of the sandwich the I never got to experience it until right before I threw the sandwich away.2. Since both meat tasted extremely salty when you eat the sandwich you can't tell the meat apart so I could have any meat and not known what I was eating.3. Thin sandwich.   I added a picture with this post.   If you see the meat and compare it to my pickle, you'll see the size.   Also, my pickle is half the size of normal.   It's as thick as a thick pencil, so really thin.   If you see my pickle you'll see it as quarter slice, not a half slice.   The sandwich is expensive for what you receive.4.   Went there around 2.   Got my sandwich at around 2:30.   Wait time was crazy and there was only 3 people in front of me but there was 5 people behind the bar.   Not sure if everyone was there to make a sandwich but it felt very slow.   I was the last person in line as well.   I don't understand what took so long but won't take a star off for that as if it had been a great sandwich I would have waited anyways.   No one said sorry for the wait so that was really disappointing.This experience was worse than my previous visit and really not worth it.   I won't be coming back here.   I gave them two stars because they had espn on the tv.",

I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy as I'm a southern native and it's hard to find anything that reminds me of Home. We also ordered the Hot Link Sandwich. Chips and Drinks are sold separate. So they don't do any combo meal with a sandwich, chips and a drink. The Po'boy is $12.99 by itself. A bit pricey but it's got huge shrimp and wonderful flavor. They give you buffalo sauce on the side to drizzle on the sandwich. It's good and picks up the heat factor but take it from a true Cajun, we don't put buffalo sauce on our po'boys lol that's what Tabasco is for. But it doesn't matter the buffalo sauce actually was really good on the sandwich. I loved it and enjoyed every bite. The Hot link sandwich with peppers and onions was also great but we thought like every other hot link sandwich it's a sandwich with a whole hot link weren't expecting pieces of hot link which is how this sandwich comes. All in all 2 sandwiches, 1 bag of chips, and 2   drinks came out to $30 and change. A little steep but I'd say it's worth it. I will be back again soon!",

I say that because I loved the pastrami sandwich here. When I say I loved it, that might be an understatement. I didn't realize this place is where my beloved Casa Gamino used to be. I loved that place so some good vibes must have been left behind to make this place so awesome. First of all, don't be overwhelmed when you walk in and look at the board. There are a good amount of options and if you're starving you'll think there are too many. I finally settled on a traditional pastrami sandwich. Just meat, cheese, and mustard. YUM! The pastrami was juicy and spicy with this amazing pepper crust. My mouth is watering as I write this because that sandwich was so good. I ordered a side of fries and they were delicious. I wish I had ordered my own side and not shared with my bf. I mean it was probably a good decision for my waistline but not a good idea for my tastebuds.

The baguette was fresh, chewy and had a nice crust on the outside. The best part was the combination of crispy hotlink, which provided a smoky dimension to the sandwich, while the coleslaw added a cool and creamy flavor.The Boss is an Italian cold cut sandwich. Pretty average. Claro's down the street does this sandwich way better at a slightly cheaper price.One weird thing.. They place the pickle and peperoncini on the plates with their bare hands. I'm sure they clean their hands, but this guy used the same hands to grab plates, season the fries, grab tongs, and grab the french fry basket.

Now, not only does it seem the entire staff is different, prices ****, meat quantity per sandwich is less. The ingredients I think are the same, but when trading down meat to stack more lettuce, the balance of flavor just isn't the same.A move from extraordinary to ordinary means it's not worth driving the extra miles anymore.   Too bad, could have had 50 purchases from me this year, now maybe 4.UPDATE:Prices are the same as opening day.   However, quantity was recently inconsistent, something that the owner(s) say they are trying to stabilize as staff fluxes.

    CustomerReviews: "Still love the food...still hate the service. The thing is--I can't tell if their employees are all extremely new to cashiering & having basic customer service skills or if they honestly just don't care. Whatever it is, management should address the issue asap, because their employees are making this place look terrible. With food of such good quality... the people serving it should probably at least act like they know what they're doing. How the food is severed is never consistent. The first time I went, we got a pickle and a side of (old looking) pasta salad/potato salad. The next time, no pickle/no side. 3rd visit, they told us we had to request a pickle and the sandwich came with bland coleslaw. They people behind the counter always look slightly confused, even more so when it comes time to serve the food. The last time I was there, my sandwich was so completely over saturated with mustard I could barely eat it. I will continue to frequent Bronx, however I'll probably only be grabbing mustard-free sandwiches to go in the future.",

The menu is a bit pricey but you get a lot of food with the order. Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had, and the sauerkraut on the sandwich made it all the better.

We also took a chance and ordered some fries... the drive home was torcher as the smell filled my car and I could not wait to dig into them! They were amazing too!

Tried to eat it but just couldn't the cheese was too overpowering. Did I mention this sandwich was almost $12?? So I called and told them my situation. Then was put on hold for 15 minutes gave up called back and was told there was a line at the store and I was still on hold because apparently past customers aren't nearly as important. I understand mistakes happen but make it right it doesn't take much. I tried to get the name of the person I was speaking to but he hung up on me before I could ask. I think I got a refund? I'm not sure it was a very confusing and uncomfortable conversation. Needless to say I will not be coming back.",

All the sandwiches I've seen looked really good and are quite large. I shared my sandwich with my son and we were both full. There's no way I could've eaten it alone!One thing I don't like is that there are no combos - everything is separate. This isn't a huge problem, but I almost always like to have chips and a drink with my sandwich, so a little price break would be nice, you know? I think they know that but don't care.

I thought the bread was dry and thick, which made it difficult to eat. I wish they had some special aioli to flavor the sandwich. Sloppy Bronx (10.99) - thinly sliced beef, all hot beef link, melted American, Swiss and Pepperjack cheese, crispy fries, coleslaw, and spicy mayo. I got to try the famous bronx sandwich and it was way better than mine. I probably favored this one because it had a spicy mayo and the sandwich included fries!!! Sub standard sandwiches for me.

They didn't take my order until other people started looking up behind me. (2) When I did order, I wanted to use a gift $20 gift card, which the staff claimed they don't have machines to read the card. Why sell gift cards that aren't redeemable. The card clearly says redeemable at all locations. I was polite and just accepted that it I wanted my food I would have to pay with my card. They should setup expectations early on so they don't disappoint customers. (3) Staff buzzed me to pickup my food, but again choose to work on other things while my food got cold.

They also have one of those fancy new soda machines with a touchscreen that dispenses 100 different types of drinks.

It wasn't just any hot dog, it was a perfectly cooked and spicy kielbasa that was salty, juicy and beefy (no jokes, please). I also ordered a NY steak sandwich ($8.99) and it looks absolutely amazing. Maybe next week when I am hungry again I can try and eat it. It's a gorgeous steak missile filled with pink and red fleshy meat-eaty-goodness, and cheese. The ratio of the other ingredients is very well-balanced, like my diet used to be until I found heaven in this sandwich shop. I had the good fortune of spending a little over a week in NYC on two different occasions. I ate my way through the city each day, all day. What I remember the most, because they were so incredibly unique and incomparable, were the sandwiches. Not the hot dogs, not the bagels, not the pizza. Bronx Sandwich Co. brings back those memories. Eat here soon, because with the amount of meat they put on these hulking sandwiches, either the prices or the place won't last. Make sure you have room in your trunk to haul your food home. You won't be able to finish it at the restaurant.Fast and friendly service, with a smile. Plenty of parking. Oh, and there are vegan options. Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go call my cardiologist.",

It was almost $30 for two sandwiches, which a little steep in my opinion considering the size of the sandwich and the fact that it doesn't come with any sides. Service is quick and friendly. It's in a small plaza but parking is readily accessible and easy to find. I highly recommend any of the hot pastrami sandwiches.",

    CustomerReviews: "This is the sandwhich joint to be at! I love me a good pastrami sandwhich. So once i saw they had the fat daddy a 1lb pastrami sandwhich my mouth began to water. My coworker told me before going that they use thick cut pastrami. I'm the type of guy that gets 5 corn beef briskets this time of year. Basically what I'm trying to say is this was the best pastrami sandwich i have EVER had. It was greasy and delicious. The amazing crust on the ends of pastrami were probably the best part.   The rye bread grilled didn't't hold up well tho. But with a lb of greasy delicious pastrami why would it? I wouldn't have wanted this sandwhich any other way. Absolutely great. I'm sad i haven't come here before today but anytime I'm feeling pastrami I'm coming here! My other coworker also said when he went he got the shrimp poboy he says he has never seen so much shrimp in a sandwhich. Such a good spot. You can't put a price on the pastrami here. Worth every penny. They also serve beer on tap not too many choices but they go well with the sandwhiches! Thanks guys!",

The meat was so good and perfectly spiced. The sauerkraut was perfectly tart. It was just fabulous!!! The Philly cheesesteak fries didn't disappoint either, they were fully loaded. Everything was on point.... This is my new sandwich spot......In addition, if you check into yelp you get a free bag of chips.

Great quality chicken and they're generous with the peppers, onions, jalape\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b1os, etc. so there's a great balance of textures between the bread, meat, and veggies. They serve it with a side of spicy mayo and I don't find it particularly spicy, but it wasn't bad.

Coming in, you're met with a large menu of hot, cold, breakfast sandwiches, salads, street fries and rice bowls.Going down the hot sandwich menu, I was up in the air between the BBQ brisket and the Pastrami, but I went with the Pastrami on Rye (you can select baguette, wheat, sourdough if you want), and loaded it up with Cole Slaw. What makes this place stand out is the meat to slaw ratio was out of bounds. You're looking at a mountain stack full of juicy fatty meat with a little bit of slaw & on delicious soft rye bread. It takes two hands to hold and an open wide mouthful to get a bite in. Once you bite into it, you're in heaven & you can taste the difference in quality.There hasn't been this type of sandwich joint in this area & I'm happy that it finally has come around.

    CustomerReviews: "UPDATE: kudos to the manager for reaching out to me and offering a replacement sandwich, but my last visit was rediculous. I always order the same thing, call in ahead of time, and pick it up under the same name. I called in a hitman today, and while picking it up, the 3 guys at the grill who obviously think the glass counter eliminates all sound, very clearly pointed me out by name and mentioned my yelp review to each other. after i clearly heard what they said and looked their way, they muttered a few other things that were unprofessional, and the main guy scurried to the back, all while all 3 just stared at me. i did not end up eating my sandwich because i've seen too many movies about stuff like this.i've been coming here for years and have been recommending it to the patrons who come into my own work down the street for years, but i guess things have changed, and I definitely won't be doing that anymore. There are plenty of sandwich shops in Tustin that treat their customers better.have you guys changed the way you make The Hitman lately? I've been buying it for year and it's always been such a perfect balance of the two meat/cheese combos, divided equally on the sandwich. Lately i've been getting a lazy version that's completely mixing the 2 different sandwich elements all over the place, and it's just not as enjoyabkas it was.",

Staff was great, they were out of several of their bread options and the ordering was cumbersome. No menu on the wall. Having to try to read the descriptions of all the sandwiches while standing at the counter and a long line behind you. That said, it was a tasty and very generous sandwich. Fries were cold and hard. Disappointed there. So all in all, I think it has potential, but may need a while to get all it ducks in a row. Looking forward to hearing other people's opinions. Thanks!",

    CustomerReviews: "We are huge sandwich fans and coming from Arizona we compare any sandwich place claiming to be the best against our beloved Ike's.This place had some high points but fell short for sure.First of all a young man named Roberto manning the customers at the front seemed entitled and bothered to help us.   We had a table of 7 and each of us ordered a sandwich.   I'd assume for a relatively empty restaurant he'd be happy to accommodate us.   It would definitely help Bronx to train him with better customer service skills.I asked him if he'd mind washing our table after I wiped it down myself but it was still sticky.   He looked at me and then pointed to his pregnant female coworker and made her do it.   She was happy and helpful.   But his customer service fell very short.The employees were arguing with one another and there was just an overwhelming attitude of unhappiness.   Maybe this was due to the fact that it was swelteringly hot inside, there was no working A/C and it was not pleasant.   The men's bathroom was occupied the entire time by an employee and not available to us the 35+ minutes we were there.The food is the only redeeming quality during our experience.   The philly, hot mess and Bronx were really good.   The ingredients on all of our sandwiches were fresh and substantial.   I agree there is a lower than average meat to lettuce/toppings/bread ratio.   But the flavor was delicious.   The pastrami is up there with the best I've had.As much as I don't want to dwell on the negative in my reviews, this experience was just a major bummer because of the customer service we received and how hot and unpleasant it was inside.",

We also ordered The Manhattan street fries and they totally hit the spot. the pieces of pastrami were sooo tasty.   You cannot go wrong here! One additional thing that I would like to add is that the soda machine produces the best tasting drinks. I rarely order a drink but i was cravin soda. My Sierra Mist was not syrupee at all.

    CustomerReviews: "West coast meets (meats?) east coast in the form of sandwiches. Based on other Yelpers who had written about the gargantuan size of these sandwiches, we decided to share. Everyone was right about the sandwiches: they are stuffed and portions are large enough to split. We tried the Sloppy Bronx, which consisted of roast beef, a hot link, American, Swiss, jalapeno, and jack cheese, fries, and coleslaw. My rule of thumb is to choose the namesake item on the menu, and thankfully, that maxim did not steer us wrong this time around. The Sloppy Bronx tasted great. The meaty roast beef, the hot and juicy sausage, the melted cheese, and the fries created an interesting combination that somehow melded together harmoniously within the baguette. I wouldn't recommend making the drive out here but it's a great option if you are in the area. Tip: Free chips with Yelp check-in. They even have Zapp's chips!",

There's a sandwich for everyone with lots of side options, fries, and also loaded fries with various toppings. I ordered the pastrami and subbed the pastrami for turkey because I liked the sauce and topping options and OMG. I was in sandwich heaven for like 10 minutes along with my potato salad and fries. If you're getting a sandwich, I really suggest you get a half portion. A full is way too much and they do not skimp on fillings. You almost have to dive in with a fork about halfway through.

    CustomerReviews: "Yes!!! Delicious sandwiches finally.   Location has great parking so no worries there.   When I visited this place, I was the only customer.   I heard this place can get pretty intense during lunch and dinner hours.   I had my meal at 3:30. Linner? :P   Regardless, price is a bit aggressive for what you get.   $11 for sandwich is quite pushing it.   This is Whole Foods status! I've had similar sandwiches before and it came to maybe 6-7 dollars max.   In light of this, sandwich was delicious.   The french bread is a bit hard so my next order would steer clear of that.   Probably stick to the rye bread instead.   They layered the content beautifully and the seasoning on it is pretty clear and presence known.   Presentation is good, other than the bread, taste is there.   Don't forget to check in and get a free back of chips.   They also give you pickle spears for free.   So if you minus the cost of the pickles and bag of chips, might be an equivalence of a $9 meal. Still a little steep for a sandwich.   At this price point, It should be able to cure something more in my body other than hunger.   Despite the high price, food is good and if the craving comes up for a delicious sandwich, I'll stop by again and see if its truly worth the buck.   I will definitely claim the chip and pickles again!   One team that I want to do is the Philly cheesesteak fries!   Looks legit.   But I recalled the pricing being around $10 bucks also. Ok.   Price needs to adjust a bit to have me as a frequent customer.   I'll give them 4 stars for quality but as a return customer, its probably valued at a 2, 3 star max.",

I've had these before - but almost never are the fries actually CRISPY inside of the burrito. This was an absolute game changer. I would highly recommend trying one of their cali burritos. The steak was a little bit meh, but the shrimp were nicely cooked and the texture with the fries was something else. Flavor was on point, at least. I also had one of their tacos - I wish I could remember which. It was nice to look at and also quite delicious. It was a tiiiiiiiny bit fishy in scent, but nothing overwhelming. Really enjoyed it. Grabbed a faux crab roll per the yelp deal - this was surprisingly delicious. Not something I expected to really enjoy :) Overall, great food. Would recommend eating here.

The mushrooms were especially good, and unique, so we had to try them.   Oh, and the house made kimchi is incredible.The owner/chef was really friendly as well.   The location is nice too, but parking is fairly competitive.   But be patient, West Coast Fish is totally worth it.",

        CustomerReviews: "Check in for half off a faux crab hand roll!Located in the Camp so parking can be tough depending on what time you go. My friend and I both ordered their salmon rice bowl. You can choose between white or brown rice and broccoli or brussel sprouts. I got white rice with broccoli while my friend ordered the exact opposite: brown rice with brussel sprouts. We also both ordered the crab hand roll.They offer complimentary Kool Aid which I haven't had in years so we sipped on that while we waited for our food. Maybe it's because I'm not a kid anymore but it was too sweet for me so I had to water it down lol.The food arrived and it was arranged so nicely in the bowl with an edible flower atop. We dug in and it was just as tasty as it looked. The salmon was slightly crispy with the skin still on and the broccoli still had some crunch and wasn't mushy or overcooked at all. The crab hand roll was pretty good too but a bit heavy on the mayo. I probably would not order this again if not for the discount.Overall I was satisfied with everything I had ordered and received, though it was on the pricier side in my opinion. I'm chalking that up to the high rent they probably have to pay with being located in the Camp.",

Was told, Jeff was not there and he was only one guy so he couldn't take our order and cook it. So sorry he said. So we went to the beach. On our way back it was 6pm. We called to see if they were open, then we went and everything we ordered, was excellent 5 stars except the really burnt overdone Brussel sprouts. I tried the mahi mahi bowl with rice and Brussel sprouts. We got the cauliflower appetizer in the goddess sauce, and shrimp taco and shrimp burrito. The tacos technically should say mini tacos, and are priced high for what you get. Stick with the burrito or power bowl for the best deal! Seafood is extremely fresh!

An entire wall covered in grass is emblazoned with grubthick in neon lights. 2. What should you get here?The staff member that assisted us noted that the most popular item is the salmon bowl followed by the crispy shrimp burrito. At her suggestion, I ordered the salmon bowl which included brown rice and broccoli. The salmon was flavorful and cooked perfectly with a crispy layer of skin. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the fish was. 3. Other notes - The parking situation at the Camp is challenging, as always. - Complimentary Kool-Aid is offered. - Sauces are provided but the restaurant was a bit stingy with them. The staff member brought out two small containers for my friend and I to share instead of bringing us our own servings. I've only been to West Coast Fish once but plan on returning.",

I was recommended the employee to order a salmon bowl. It turned out to be a good recommendation. The green beans were outstanding. It was deep fried with a sour lemon taste with almonds. The brown rice didn't taste dry and the salmon was very juicy and crispy. It was about $15 for the bowl. Better than I expected. They had homemade kool-aid served there for some reason.

You might be thinking why? Wellllllllll, it's because of the West Coast Fish. I have to come here. I need this place. I came here on a late Wednesday afternoon. My colleagues and I wanted to try something new & this place popped in my mind. I mean, I've scrolled through their pictures & dreamed about what could be if I could just have a bite. I was ecstatic upon finding out my colleagues wanted to try this place as well & they would drive. ( I told you, I really hate the parking situation here) We ended up getting lucky and parking right away. Upon entering, I was surprised to see an empty restaurant. But hey, every place has their down time. I giggled inside at their shirts and honestly, will probably be back to buy one. Oh well.I ordered the crispy shrimp taco & a side of broccoli.My colleagues had the mahi taco, the shrimp, the crispy shrimp, the grilled avocado, & a side of fries.First of all, that crispy shrimp taco was THE best crispy shrimp taco I have had. The little cuts of watermelon salsa on top of that taco made it so refreshingly unbelievable. The broccoli? It came in a heaping portion & with pickled peppers on top. The super nice lady who was at the counter, noticed how much I liked the peppers, she brought some more on the side on her own accord. Wow. What service! My coworkers and I loved this place. We all raved about the delicious food & I believe there were many points in time I didn't want to be talked to. Why? The food. It overtook me.Thank you West Coast Fish for the awesome food, the service, & the merch on the walls. Pretty sure you guys will see us back shortly",

It's a pretty small place where you order from the counter and sit at one of the two large plank tables with tall stools. Their lunch special sounded good. A good sized piece of salmon that I ordered with brown rice. No veggies, which was a bummer, but I did get half off a faux crab hand roll with my yelp check in. The roll was amazing. I was very surprised at the texture and flavor. The fish was excellent. A dense, fresh and flavorful cut, perfectly seasoned and cooked. This was a really good meal, outside the lack of veggies.

We had a crazy night at the beer festival last night and my hangover is raging. We were starving and craving a big, delicious, West Coast fish wrap. My husband ordered through Postmates and when we opened our order we found it paled in comparison to what we are used to. The size of the burritos (wraps) today are SO small today in comparison to usual we actually wondered if they ran out of food or something. As a matter of fact it doesn't even taste the same. I always order the crispy shrimp and was anticipating the usual deliciousness, but today it is just sad, dry, and small.

        CustomerReviews: "How am I just hearing about this place? Wild caught fish (except salmon--please get wild caught salmon too!) that tastes amazing and super fresh tasting veggies? Sold. I had the mahi with no rice--extra veggies and it was perfect. The customer service was great and the seating was fine. The only downside of the place is the location--the camp is a nightmare to park at. I'm going to come at off hours and I wouldn't be surprised if I was here weekly--or more often.Very high quality and highly recommended!! Thanks!",

        CustomerReviews: "3.5A healthier option if you're looking to avoid eating greasy fatty food. It's a small hip place that offers a variety of fish meals (wraps, poke, tacos, rice bowls) in the Lab next to Milk and Honey.   Parking is cramped here but what can you do.   I was impressed by the signage and old school rap CDs as wait numbers.   The fish is fresh, and the entrees are presented simply and beautifully.   However, if I would come back I would wish they they could be more creative dishes with other seasonal ingredients. Also, a pro would also be having their liquor license.   In comparison to California Fish Grill and Slapfish, the pricing is more expensive.   About $10 for a wrap, $15/$16 for a fish rice bowl.   I was content with my Salmon Bowl and would come back to try other items.",

        CustomerReviews: "So, I've come here twice now, and here's my final verdict. This place makes some hella tasty wraps (read: burritos) and some tasty tacos. But! When this place is busy, it suffers from the overload of people. Here's why:First time: I got the steak wrap, no guacamole. Coming to a joint that lauds their fish and instead get steak? It was crazy, but I saw someone else with it and that decided for me. Their steak wrap was awesome; the watermelon pico, corn, rice, forementioned steak was an excellent size (not too huge like Chipotle, not small like some upscale pompous retake on Mexican that uses street taco tortillas for the wrap). I loved the watermelon take on pico; the accompanying sauce was zingy and an excellent addition, the steak was well cooked, rice was rice. Food aside, I came after the lunch rush (like 1:30pm). It's a fairly small joint, with cafeteria long bench style seating, maybe thirty chairs. We ordered quickly and we're served in scant time later. The burrito was good enough I went back a couple days later, telling about friend about how good the food was. So, second time: I decide to try the tacos, and go for a crunchy shrimp and a mahi taco. More watermelon pico, some smoky tasty sauce, lots of green. I order to go this time, because the place was packed full (not one chair open). This is around 12:15-12:30. My friend does the same. There were a few people waiting ahead of us on their food, and then suddenly the lunch rush cleared. My food comes out like 12:50, my friend's like 1pm. It took a while for our food to come out; no big deal. I can see that it has a small kitchen and a very sparse staff that are all multitasking like pros, and I can see how crazy it must have been with the whole place packed. My one complaint was that after I got my order and left, when I'm opening the package into my second taco, I see that there is no tortilla. The first taco had one, my second didn't. That basically didn't make it a taco, and that was disappointing. I'd chock it up to the place being in a rush. I'd go back, but I'd eat in house and make sure my taco was actually a taco next time.",

Generally they are slow to serve food even when there are no pending orders ahead of you. On top of the slow service, today the order came out fompletely wrong. I ordered a poke salmon bowl and was told they ran out asked for another dish and that was out to. So went to a 3rd option and then was told poke is available. Well I could not be nore clear I didnt want rice as she asked me each time white or brown I said no and asked for veggies. The server kept nodding which I assumed was agreement but I now believe she was just going along to the good music they were playing. Either way food came out too slowly so that I could not correct them. Ended up with hot white rice and 2 ounces of mashed salmon that had a fishy after taste (not a good sign). West coast is cool to hang out at just be aware if you are in a time crunch or need specific orders, you may want to write it down for them.",

Not that they taste bad but it's strange. Ok. That's not the bad part. How can you serve me a bowl half filled with the throw away parts of broccoli with dignity and pride? Seriously? If I wanted to eat out of the trash I'd join the homeless and give up on life. Both mine & my girlfriends fish bowl had the same problems. They were both filled halfway with the bottom hard stems of broccoli. No thanks. How about a little more sauce too. The sauces came in a little plastic cup I guess to dip our fish in. But it really wasn't enough to get through these dry pieces of fish. You'll never see me order from here. Unfortunately my girlfriend ordered this stuff. Well now, I've had an interesting character that supposedly represents this place named Chris N. He has left my girlfriend & I some disrespectful & incorrect messages. For one, this person says he saw me here, yet when my girlfriend went to get this garbage I was at home working on one of my cars. So clearly he is making up some excuse to talk trash without truth behind it. My review is backed by photos and a long standing Yelp review history. I travel this country and I've eaten at more places than any other person you could think of. I've only been a helper for a very short part of that time.

I knew the place was at The Camp so I strolled on over to check it out. The first thing I noticed about West Coast Fish was how clean it was and how the colors made me feel like I was at a pier or a fish market. I had a really good feeling about this place.I took some time to look at the menu and wasn't able to decide. Their staff was kind enough to show me their Instagram with all their food pictures. And to my surprise, I ordered the Caesar Salad (I actually never order salads) and a side of the Mahi Mahi. I have to admit, it was one of the best salads I've had.The Caesar Salad was voluminous with fresh parmesan grated and lightly peppered. It was tossed, making the salad very well balanced.The Mahi Mahi was delightful. It was not overcooked and seared well on the skin side, giving the fillet a light crunchy texture. Their staff even checked in with me to see if I enjoyed my meal, which I absolutely did.Highly recommend everyone giving this place a try. Let them toss your salad.

The wild tuna bowl I got with double veggies ($1 more) instead of rice.   The texture and flavor of the broccolini and the Brussels sprouts were right up my alley. They serve a very large portion of fish so I really didn't miss the rice. We also tried a salmon bowl.

Peasant sized portions and 4 bowls cost $78, to order at a counter and eat at a community table from cardboard bowls and cutlery. the brussels sprouts are the highlight of the restaurant. my advice wld be definitely the addition of pictures on the menu, we didn't know what we were eating! And also maybe cheaper prices, this seems really steep to be paying for such a casual dining experience. Probably won't come back which is a shame because the service was kind and the atmosphere cute but didn't match the price!",

I've been ordering their salmon and rice lunch bowls and it's consistent every time. I've also become obsessed with their sticky shrimp, and I get it with a side of rice. Try it. You will thank me. You will become obsessed. You will crave that sticky shrimp. Also their kimchi. Hot damn, Roy chars the cabbage for the kimchi!!! I'm Korean and have been eating kimchi my whole life, and this guy is just here making bomb-ass kimchi, the best I've ever had!! Eat here.",

        CustomerReviews: "Super duper! Tried this new spot on Sunday. Pretty much painted the menu. Salmon bowl w/brussel sprouts: crunchy and moist fish. I don't like brussel sprouts so NOT a fan.Mahi mahi w/ broccolini- good flavor on the broccoli. The fish was great but a little bland until they brought me goddess dressing and then my bowl was next level. Came with crinkle fries too. My favorite.Poke- yum. It wasn't red like what I'm used to so I asked and was explained to that higher grade tuna portions near the belly are lighter in color. Tasted really good though.Baja fish taco: it was so so. The batter was a little thin and poor texture.Shrimp taco: my husband and my friend LOVED these. They wouldn't let me try it! The highlight of the meal was the cauliflower. OMG I don't even like cauliflower. Whatever they did with it and the green goddess dressing made it out of this world!!!Super clean place. VERY good prices!Free koolaid and 90s music references.

Plump shrimp that is ACTUALLY CRISPY combined with watermelon pico, a little guacamole, corn, rice, and lettuce make for exactly what a shrimp burrito should be! I grabbed a bottle of hot sauce thinking I would need it for extra flavor, but this burrito was best enjoyed either just a squeeze of lemon and a cold beer.Interior is super clean.

Soooo happy I listened!!To start, Johnica was at the register and helped me decide what to try first. She was very helpful and pleasant! I had the wild Mahi bowl with Brussels sprouts. They even served it with a little side of house made kimchi. Roy, owner and chef, cooked my Mahi and the veggies to perfection!!! Seasoned and cooked so amazingly! I don't even LIKE kimchi but I loved the kimchi here! Perfect blend of spicy, garlicky goodness with a hint of smokiness. Portions were generous and I was totally satisfied. Some might think $17 is a bit much for a little mall restaurant, but not me. Worth every penny. Fish is fresh and the presentation was beautiful. (My dad owned a restaurant and was a chef so I know food.)I can't wait to come back!! And yes, I will drive from the South Bay to eat here! Thank you for an incredible dinner experience!",

The food came out pretty quickly and the presentation was super cute and appetizing. Most importantly, the food was delicious!!! Really simple but really flavorful.   The cauliflower were the best I've ever had. Next time I might just order like 7 sides of it. Fish was cooked perfectly with a crispy outter layer and a soft center. Brussel sprouts were seasoned really well. Heads up though, they have sliced almonds so careful if you're allergic. Rice was cooked nicely but I like a lot of salt and pepper on my rice but I didn't see any out on the tables (the rice would be yummy for a normal person.

Sometimes I've found that it's little hidden gems like this that have some of the best quality fish around. Growing tired of the same poke spots opening up on every corner of the city with similar menus I decided I'd give this spot a chance. I ordered the crispy shrimp burrito which has white rice, lettuce, avocado, battered fried shrimp, corn and a mango spicy pico de Gallo. Needless to say the fried shrimp was so fresh and perfectly battered. The mango pico was just the right amount of flavor and spice. I'm used to ordering a shrimp burrito from chronic taco or Baja Fresh and only enjoying them after drenching them in sauce. WCF is so fresh and the flavors are great without adding sauce or chili.

Salmon Bowl with fries and Brussels sprouts 5/5 OK EVERYONE MUST TRY THIS ONE! GAWDDDD IT'S SOOO GOOOD!!! Probably one of the BESTT cooked salmon I ever tasted. Super crispy skin on the outside and juicy, buttery meat on the inside...it's mind blowing. Seriously get it. The brussels sprouts were cooked to perfection. Everything was lightly salted and not overbearing with salt like some other seafood restaurants.   Tuna Poke 5/5 Fresh tuna sashimi fish diced with green onions, avocado, spicy mayo tasted so good together. I'm picky when it comes to good tasting sushi rice and they definitely got my approval for it!",

Clean & hip.Fresh food filled with delicious flavors.Great price for the quality of food provided.I ordered the cauliflower, the side glazed shrimp, beet hummus, the pita bread and Brussels sprouts to start off with. As the entree I had the mahi fish wrap. I know, sounds like a lot but everything just sounded so good. Every plate had a twist of its own flavor and every bite was fresh and delicious.I can't wait to go back to try the avocado and salmon dishes!Highly recommend this spot!",

It didn't take that long to be served and after trying their food every minute could be worth the wait. The food was super fresh; different seasoning, and well cooked. The menu is very simple.

        CustomerReviews: "Let me start by saying that this place has amazing food. The cauliflower is a must order and the fish is ultra fresh.The reason for only three stars is the inconsistency of the portion size. I came here on Friday (3.17) with my best friend and everything was phenomenal. Portion size was huge and price was decent for the quality of food.However, just stopped by on Sunday (3.19) and got an order of the cauliflower and Bowl to go. When I got home and opened up my goodies, the portion size was significantly smaller. How much smaller? I only got three pieces of cauliflower...for $5. That's ridiculous.I'm disappointed in my order this time around. The food is amazing but I can't justify coming back if my portion size is going to be that little or inconsistent.",

        CustomerReviews: "The food here is exceptional.   I had the Caesar salad with wild shrimp Ala carte. The Caesar salad is not traditional, it's made with tahini, anchovy, sumac, gem & frisee lettuce, & kale. It's really tasty, very fresh & crisp. The shrimp were super delicious. I mentioned when placing the order that I was on a very low carb keto diet, & they offered some grass fed clarified butter as well as adding on extra cheese so I could get some extra fat!    This was great, so glad that their menu is basically Ketogenic friendly.I also had the broccolini.   It was cooked perfectly, grilled with char marks & still crunchy. They put some pickled red peppers as garnish & it goes perfectly giving just a bit of acid to the flavor profile.   With so many viable Ketogenic options, I added the cauliflower & brussle sprouts too! Both of these was fantastic! So much flavor in   them.Texture of everything was great too, really good food here.   Salad was crunchy, shrimp were plump & juicy.   Couldn't ask for more really!",

        CustomerReviews: "Truly not sure how you get this far with 4+ stars but lets stick to the facts. I had a bad first experience here ( extremely lengthy wait time with 3 other customers there and still got my order wrong) but due to their great reviews I decided a 2nd try is in order. We ordered a salmon bowl with only brussel sprouts, no rice, and a caesar salad.   28 minutes into waiting, the customers sitting next to use who had also ordered salmon bowls received their food even though we had ordered a full 10 minutes ahead of them. Of course I spoke to the person at the register who apologized   then handed me a to-go bag that was sitting near the register for at least a few minutes ( we stated we were dining in) and thought fine, ill just take it to go and headed to work only to realize that the order was completely wrong - salmon bowl with rice and broccoli, no brussel sprouts in sight, and the salad seemed dry and wilted (probably from sitting on the counter for some time.) I tried to call the manager and see if we can resolve this over the phone and was told he was busy... Unless you have a lot of free time you'd like to waste waiting around for your incorrect order, I'd highly suggest you try elsewhere.",

        CustomerReviews: "New spot opened up at the camp right next to milk and honey. I heard about through my local skater Philly phil and I gotta say this place is pretty bomb. It's nice to see another seafood spot opening up around town. Service -   the cashiers were friendly. Service did seemed a bit rushed though but it's no biggy seeing as the place just opened up they just need to get used to it. Food - dude the fresh is hella fresh and well cooked. I got the Yellowtail bowl with white rice and brussel sprouts. This shit is legit fire. The fish is grilled, so I thought be dry but it was moist all the way through. ( Tip: if the fish is fresh it should break up with just a fork.)The rice was perfectly cook. The brussel sprouts were off putting cause to me it's an odd thing for me to see brussel sprouts and cook fished together but the flavor dynamics complement each other very well.   What a real surprise was the almond shavings sprinkled on top of the brussel sprouts. It really helped balance out the individual bitterness of the sprouts. It's reasonably priced for what you get. 10/10 to me.Atmosphere - the vibe this place has is pretty killer. I love the hip hop references. Their dining area isn't that big but it has alot of seating. The decor is pretty hipster but it's not a bad thing, the place looks great.Overall, if you want reasonably priced food with a good atmosphere try this place out. I'll be back again eventually to try out more things on the menu.",

I keep coming back for their salmon and their shrimp especially, both cooked perfectly so that they're not too dry or too chewy. Portion sizes also run on the larger side, which is no problem cause you end up eating the entire thing cause of how good it is. Recipes are very well balanced, with interesting sides. I highly recommend the sticky shrimp and the Brussels sprouts deserve a second shout out. The only downside to this place is that the storefront is very small, right next to milk and honey but there is enough seating inside. Parking is also very hard to find if you come at the wrong time, since they're at the Camp but this is one of those gems that worth coming back to every time!",

        CustomerReviews: "TLDR: This place is amazing, get the Bjorn Battered Taco.So, I stopped by this place with a friend right after they opened. We had already had lunch, so we were just checking out the menu. They had a beer battered fish taco that my not-such-a-huge-fan-of-fish friend wanted to try out.A couple days later we came back to get lunch and try out said taco. Plot twist, no more beer battered fish tacos! So, we went elsewhere, planning to come back and try again another day. We stopped by a couple more times, and still no beer battered tacos! Things were starting to get a little rocky in our relationship with West Coast Fish at this point. Do you feel the tension building?My friend got a little upset on our last try because he had his heart set on this taco! He had been let down one too many times, and swore the place off...never coming back. This is the break up scene...but will they work it out and get back together?Today, I went back. I was with my same friend, but he had already eaten lunch so he wasn't emotionally invested in the endeavor. We walk in, gaze upon the menu to find the BJORN BATTERED FISH TACO.Remember that not not-such-a-huge-fan-of-fish friend I've told you so much about? Well, his name is Bjoern. Not only did they make a beer battered fish taco, they named it after the crazy guy who kept asking for something they clearly didn't have on the menu.That's the end of my story. I'm glad you stuck with me through this, just like we stuck with West Coast Fish. The pay off was well worth it. How's that for a happy ending? Now go eat a taco!",

My mom and SIL got a salmon entree with the same veggies. We also got a side of mushrooms. After sampling a bite of each other's entrees, we cumulatively decided my crispy shrimp wrap was the best! I put the cilantro dressing inside (although great alone as well) and it was delicious. This was an hour after, placed in the fridge, and reheated.

        CustomerReviews: "I'm really torn with this place. I'll start off by saying that the food (yellowtail and salmon) was delicious and that the workers there were very nice. I also thought the restaurant was really clean, which is a big plus. I have to give the low stars because we got food poisoning. I have to note that the salmon was the only thing that my boyfriend and I shared to eat the entire day, which is how we came to the conclusion that the salmon was the culprit. My boyfriend threw up numerous times and I had an upset stomach the majority of the night. Maybe we got unlucky, but we really wanted to love this place.",

Who does this at an order-at-the-counter place? Who does this at all?!   They are out of Kool Aid (Yelp check-in) and turns out its free all the time anyway.. but they are out.   Rather lame..Sorry, you just shouldn't run out of something you're using in a promo.    Trendy order-at-the-counter place with rather overpriced fried, battered fish and shrimp (small) tacos.. they do also have a grilled Mahi taco on the menu as well as a Veggie.. They also have salads, wraps and bowls- didn't try those.   Overall, felt like a rip-off..(after the update above, even more!)",

They offer wild caught items grilled over robata, or just crazy fresh seafood items raw or cured, and surrounded by just the freshest ingredients.   This type of food quality is found in the finest restaurants.   They keep it casual inside, so bring your own candle if you are trying to make this an intimate dinner. The tables are communal so bring a group to fill the whole table or you will probably make a friend.   Honestly though, it's like they said forget about the boushey ambiance we are putting our money into the food...and that they did.

The rice was fluffy and flavorful, the Brussels sprouts were just HEAVENLY, and the broccoli was al dente perfection. The spicy Kimchee was really good and both of their house sauces complimented the dish perfectly.

The perfect seasoned salmon just melts in your mouth and the crispy skin is just the added touch. The brussel sprouts were beyond amazing-crispy, flavorful, and nutty. I like the almonds added with it. Pure genius. Cauliflower had to be the extra hit to the tastebuds. Although, I usually prefer to have my cauliflower softer (probably should have left it cooking for a little bit more), the sauce and cilantro on the cauliflower made me forget that. The combined flavors of the fresh cilantro and sauce had me wanting more. For improvements though, rice is way too much in these bowls. It's so filling with all the veggies and fish already. I think rice or veggies should be an option, not both in one bowl. I'd like to have the no carb option. Like I said before, cauliflower needs to be cooked a little long for the added softness.   Love the cilantro sauce. Not a big fan of the chipotle sauce. Overall, will come back again for that yummy fish.",

        CustomerReviews: "First time at West Coast last night. Wanted a quick fish dinner before seeing Cirque du Soleil at the OC Fairgrounds. Last time we were here it was a raw food place--tried it once and never came back. Now it's really good! First thing we noticed was that the young woman who acted as hostess and waitress seemed very nice, welcoming, and genuine. She exhibited the kind of enthusiasm you only see from owners, not hired help--I'm betting she's attached to the chef-owner in some way. If not, he's lucky to have her. We tried something from each category (except tacos): wrap, bowl, and salad. All were surprisingly good--a cut above the usual. For example, the broccoli that came with my salmon was very lightly blanched (if at all), then a quick hit on the grill, giving a touch of char that made it a nice contrast to the limp steamed stuff that often comes in such bowls. The fish was skin-on to keep it moist from the grill and not over-done. Could have been a bit thicker, but good. Did I mention the quantities? Very generous rice and veggies.The citrus salad was my favorite, easily enough in one order to feed three. A very nice combination of Asian greens, sliced almonds, crispy wontons, thinly sliced radish, and freshly supremed oranges, and a tangy citrus dressing laced with smoked sesame oil. I practically licked the bowl. All ingredients were very fresh and freshly prepared. Excellent!No fancy decor here, just simple, straightforward, and clean. They offer beer and wine (better wine choices, please!), and a range of sodas. These kids deserve your support. Imaginative and skillfully rendered SoCal fusion fish-centered casual chow. This could be the next Wahoo's, get here before they're spoiled by success. Wink-wink",

        CustomerReviews: "If you're a seafood enthusiast like myself, this place is for you. My husband and I ate here this last weekend and were both extremely impressed by how fresh everything tasted and the amount of food that was given per order.   I ordered the tuna poke bowl with a side of cauliflower. The tuna bowl blew me away as it had small little crunchy rice like balls that gave the dish a unique flavor. Their cauliflower was tossed in an incredible cilantro sauce, which totally makes the dish amazing.Hubby ordered tacos. Two fish and one shrimp . He loved it so much he didn't even offer me a single bite, which forced me to go back to the counter and order and additional one for myself.   I love this place because the food tastes so fresh and the   prices are very reasonable for the amount of flavor each item is packed with. The entire staff is super nice and helpful and continuously checked up on us the entire time we were eating. Like I said before, if you enjoy seafood this is a place you definitely need to check out. Five stars all the way !!!!#yummmmm",

It was light and refreshing, we felt bad for The stuff that we're working there, because the air conditioning was broken and it was very hot inside. Despite the heat, the employees were very nice and helpful, and gave us extra sauce. We also got the salmon bowl which was cooked very nice and delicious with the chipotle Smokey sauce. It was a lot of food, more than I thought we would get it. We ordered a side of brussels sprouts that were delicious, but we didn't really need them. We will be going back there soon!",

        CustomerReviews: "I've been here twice and both times the ingredients have been on point! Everything is incredibly fresh! The shrimp is amazing!! My boyfriend and I have ordered it both times and each time it was perfectly cooked! I'm still trying to work out what's the best thing to order so here's my opinion so far:Obviously with a new place, the menu will revolve and work out some kinks. Here are some things to take into account when ordering: I love Brussel Sprouts so ordered it with my bowl. I found them to be really heavy and rich, making my stomach hurt halfway through my meal.   They taste great, so if you can handle food cooked in a lot of oil then go for it! But if you're sensitive, then I'd order the broccolini.   The tacos are served on a homemade tortilla that is smaller than street taco size. But they pile on the fillings. So you can't exactly eat it as a taco without making a mess and loosing half your fillings to the plate. However if you're cool with those factors the tacos don't disappoint in flavor! They're delicious. Just wish it was a larger tortilla!   The cauliflower was delicious! All around I will keep coming back and I'm so excited that this place came to the camp!",

I've never tried watermelon salsa before but the grilled shrimp wrap has it in it and is seriously the best thing I've had in quite a while. The staff is genuine, and helpful with suggestions. I tend to enjoy businesses that make it a point to be more down to earth and you get that here. The area here has been lacking a quick healthy spot like West Coast Fish so I'm happy they've moved in to the Camp on Bristol. I'll definitely be a regular going forward.",

The fish was seasoned perfectly to my liking. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare)as well.   There was no need to drown the fish with all sorts of marinade and spices because it was so fresh. The portions were a good size. The Brussels sprouts were good and they gave me plenty of brown rice which again was cooked perfectly.   The place is not cheap ($15 for my tuna bowl) but I am happy to pay a little extra to get the freshness this placer offers. My son ordered one of each of their tacos and loved them!

        CustomerReviews: "Initially I was bummed to find that nearly all of their bowls consist of cooked fish.   But that disappointment disappeared on bite number one.   The SALMON BOWL has salmon that looks to have been brushed with olive oil which helps to trap in moisture.   This fish was perfectly cooked with nice moisture throughout and some flakiness on the exterior.   The crispy skin was separated and also in the bowl.   This is so GOOD!   The brown rice has an oily sheen as well and is very moist with great texture.   There are finely grated carrot shavings and a green veggie on top.   The portions of everything is nicely distributed and is fair for the price paid.Browned BRUSSEL SPROUTS cooked in olive oil, sea salt and maybe garlic (I'm guessing) were resting underneath.   These had some good crunch and were perfectly cooked as well.   From A to Z, this bowl was prepared and cooked to perfection.The CAULIFLOWER side with CILANTRO SAUCE was amazing!   That sauce is to die for and should NOT be used too sparingly.   The STAFF were friendly and helpful and the inside had that NYC subway tile thing going on from what I recall.",

I actually have no idea what they serve. I am just hungry and I am willing to give a try. As soon as I had couple bites of my salmon and broccolini bowl, I leap out my chair to ask chef what kind of grill he use? . Chef gleefully told me he used a Japanese charcoal grill. I can not believe it, Someone is willing to go through the trouble to cook with charcoal?!!!?There are not that any restaurants cook with charcoal in Sol Cal and there is one in my backyard!? Can this be real???!!!The flavor was so unexpected, grilled to the right degree of crispy and slightly charred outside, lock all the moisture inside. Someone is willing jut focus on the art of grill not to get distracted by bunch of culinary concoction,   really let the true flavor of produce peaks it self. Even their kimchee tastes different.

Their food is amazing imo, love that the salmon is grilled with very minimal seasoning so you can experience all of the salmon flavors. Rice is nicely cooked to the perfect texture, not too hard, not too soggy. The only problem is the customer service here is kinda awkward. Consider they all look like surfer dudes, you'd expect a chill vibe lol. But it seems like they dgaf most of the time and maintain a very pokerface while dealing with customers. on top of that, they always forget to throw in a side of sauce every single time I ordered even though I've clearly mentioned that I'd like one. Overall, I'd recommend this place, I'd also recommend that you double check your order to make sure you've got what you wanted.",

Fellow OC Yelper Steve S. originally clued me on the greatness of BRONX Sandwich Company and I made it a point to visit the Costa Mesa as soon as possible to give their take on a Pastrami Sandwich. I am glad I did, I found a great new spot for the luncheon rotation. The menu is simple, straightforward\u00e2\u0080\u008b and as creative as any sandwich spot would ever need to be. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable so you really have no reason to give these guys the Pepsi challenge. They offer two distinctly different Pastrami sandwiches. The East Coast Pastrami is \u00e2\u0080\u008bclassic and the West Coast is an abomination to mankind with melted American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, may, \u00e2\u0080\u008b and mustard. Do not go this route. It is sheer heresy. Okay - full transparency here, folks - I have actually tried the West Coast version and it is better than it has any right to be. The East Coast Pastrami, \u00e2\u0080\u008bhowever, is a powerhouse in smoked & brined Brisket. A decent amount of piping hot Pastrami and Gulden's mustard is the ingredient list. Well, that and the addition of your choice of delivery mechanism (go with the Rye. No, really... get the Rye). All of the ingredients are deafeningly fresh and the tangy zip of the mustard cuts through the salty, smoky Pastrami meat seemingly in unison making BRONX Sandwich Company's Pastrami quite unique. It could be argued that the Rye was a bit muted but that would be countered easily with the fact it doesn't get in the way. A very real contender in OC's anemic Pastrami scene. I am a big fan of BRONX Sandwich Company and also Steve S. for helping me find them. There is also another location now in Tustin. Check them out!",

My BF and I used to live in Tustin and Bronx was our go to place for delicious sandwiches and fries.My brother and I were in Costa Mesa looking for something kind of  healthy  and I just HAD to take him to Bronx. He loved it!This location is located in a Target parking lot off Harbor with ample parking. We found it easy to find, just south of the 405 fwy.We visited on a Sunday afternoon around 230pm. There was no wait with many open tables.The food was just as amazing as the Tustin location and the service super fast. We had the Bronx Club, which is one of my faves. I didn't get to try the fries at this location, although it is one of my favorites on their menu. The sandwich was packed with meat and toppings and bread was delicious as always. Their baguette is so delicious I would eat it without the meat! Their sandwiches are pretty big and filling. You could share or save half for later. Price is a littttllllleee pricey, as I mentioned in my other review for Bronx. But it's honestly worth every penny. It's about $11 for a sammie. But there's really nothing cheap these days! If you're going to spend money on food, you might as well buy quality. And Bronx is definitely quality food. Thank you Bronx for being consistent in your restaurants! It makes me want to keep coming back no matter the location. I have also previously reviewed Bronx Tustin location, check it out :)",

There's nearly 20 different hot sandwiches alone, and most are as likely to activate your taste buds as they are to raise your blood pressure. These sandwiches are hearty, to say the least.I opted for the East Coast Pastrami, which is a no-nonsense stack of thinly sliced pastrami on rye. My favorite delis in NY would cut their meat thicker, but you take what you can get out here, so I'm not complaining. They give you the option of grilling your bread, which I recommend just so it doesn't fall apart under the meat juices so quickly. The sandwich was pretty tasty, if not heavy on the sodium. I also got a side of fries, which were a crispy complement to the pastrami.It's certainly not a health-conscious choice, but Bronx Sandwich Company will definitely satisfy your cravings for large and meaty sandwiches!

We also thought the spicy mayo would be IN it not all over it, but I guess the name of the sandwich should've told us something was up. I guess we just thought it was messy, as in so many ingredients you could barely hold it together. As you can see, it was more than enough for both of us. It was okay, but nothing special. The jalape\u00c3\u00b1os were out where we could grab them, and they weren't stingy with ranch...although the ranch wasn't very good. If you've read my reviews before, I'm a huge fan of ranch, and GOOD ranch, so I guess it's no wonder they weren't stingy with it.

However today when I walked in inside the place was extremely hot .   I asked about the air temperature because we wanted to dine there . The front desk girl looked at me like I was a little crazy for asking . It has now been over 20 minutes and they just started our order . As much as I love this sandwiches , I will think twice about going back. Very disappointed and sad I needed to yelp this .",

I asked for cheese on one half of the sandwich and they did it!   No smart ass comments about not liking cheese they just said yes. Another plus 1....Clean interior Another plus 1....They have cookies at the register which is great because who doesn't like cookies??? Just serial killers and donald trump....so another plus 1...How do they get to 5 stars ?

Front cashier was very helpful in narrowing down a Selection and I thanked her for her good service (3/31 @12ish) Apparently they are known for their pastrami and the hot West Coast sandwich did not disappoint.   I checked in on yelp and I got an order of fresh kettle chips for free. I was actually surprised at how expensive a sandwich and a soda was.   I think I spent pretty close to $15.   However the sandwich was delicious and I had leftovers for a second meal.   I don't eat a lot so this may not apply for everyone.   I got my sandwich on baguette and it was perfect.

These were good, but the fries were pretty undercooked. This, or even half of this, is enough for a lunch.2. Got an Americas Most Wanted, and while the bread, grilled onions and mustard was good, the meat was quite bland, being greatly overpowered by the additives around it.3. As my order was to go, I packed up condiments to take with me. Unfortunately the lids were wrong and too small, making it almost impossible to put them on without folding the inner cup lid back in a bit of trickery. I'd appreciate it if these were readyto grab and go... especially when a sandwich is $11, and the PCS fries were $9.Don't expect to have your sandwiches look anything like the photos. The meat or onions in mine was not visible outside the bun when I unwrapped it.I'll try it again, probably the pastrami next, and update review as necessary.",

My wife's club sandwich was missing the thing that makes something a club sandwich - the bacon. How can you forget the bacon on a club sandwich??   3. My child's sandwich was supposed to come with fries, but we didn't get any. I called to complain, and the person who answered was very nice. She told me she'd let the manager know that I'd like to speak to them. I left my number, but I never heard from this person. So they went 0 for 3 on my order, and I'm out over 30 dollars.

Its located in the space previously occupied by Daphne's.I ordered the baja chicken ($9.49 | chicken, cheese, onions & peppers).   They offer numerous hot and cold sandwiches, as well as salads.   In addition, there are options for non-red meat eaters like turkey pastrami.   BTW, chips are complimentary with Yelp checkin (normally $2.99).My sandwich was winnahz.   It was packed full of meat and fresh, grilled veggies:   5 Stars.   The sandwich reminded me a lot of John's Philly Grille (also 5 Stars).   I could have easily just eaten half, but I decided to eat the entire sandwich and save the chips.   Lastly, this sandwich blew away Ikes on Brookhurst in FV.   The latter has no meat in its sandwiches.Secondarily, the chips were nice and thick, and well seasoned.   In addition, the portion was massive.   The only downside is they could have been warmer:   4 Stars.Regarding the ambiance, its not fancy.   There are tables indoor and outside for you to enjoy your massive sandwich:   3 Stars.On the other hand, the service was excellent.   My sandwich was taking a little longer than expected. However, the Viet fellow (manager type or owner), explained things to me, and brought me my sandwich as soon as it came off the grill.   That's good service!:   5 Stars.I now have another sandwich place besides John's to hit.   I'd like to try their Italian on a cheat day, or the turkey pastrami on my next visit.",

Checking in with the Yelp app gave me a free chips as a side. The  chips are like a cross between potato chips and french fries. They tasted dry, although some had some oil still on them. They probably would have tasted better if I had used ketchup as a dipping sauce (next time). The sandwich tasted of bread from the first bite. The meat of the sandwich seemed to stay to one side of it until I ate on that side. What followed was a strong mustard taste with onions until the meat kicked in. It was good but too big for my britches and I had to call it quits about half way through the second of my sandwich. The bread was too much for me to finish.The atmosphere is a bit like Jimmy Johns. There was a variety of different seating for people who like to sit high or low. The service was five (5) star. They hand out the vibrating order ready blocks after they take your order.I see myself coming here again to try one or two more sandwiches but they are lacking in a good italian and meatball sub respectively (they are two of my top picks in sandwiches). If you are a really big fan of pastrami this place is definitely worth a try.",

            CustomerReviews: "I love sandwiches, both hot and cold, so I was excited to try a new place in the Costa Mesa area. Bronx Sandwich Company has 3 locations (Costa Mesa, Anaheim, and Tustin) and offers a selection of NY-influenced sandwiches and salads. The Costa Mesa location is located in a pretty big plaza with Target and Sprouts. Service was great - the cashier went over the menu and most popular sandwiches with me.After much thought, I ordered The Philly Cheese, which has thinly sliced beef, melted Provolone & American cheese, grilled bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and mayo. After about 7-8 minutes, my sandwich was ready. I enjoyed the taste of the sandwich, but it was super oily. The components of the sandwich were delicious, but my fingers were drenched in oil after a few bites. At $12~ for a sandwich, I thought it was a little pricey, so I'm not sure if I'd be back. The Yelp check-in for the free chips was a nice touch. I loved how thick the chips were, but the seasoning on the chips wasn't even. Some of the chips had no flavor, whereas other flavors were super salty.Since Bronx Sandwich Company is still pretty new in Costa Mesa, I'm sure they're still working out some of the kinks. While this wouldn't be my go-to sandwich shop in Costa Mesa, I might consider coming back sometime. In the future, I'd love to see some half sizes of sandwiches on the menu!",

This time the sandwiches were filled with with the proper amount of meat and toppings and tasted great.    The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is the soda cups are the size of solo cups, for $2.99 not worth it unless you refill it several times. I hope they get regular size cups.

I went during lunch hour but luckily it did not take long at all to wait in line or receive my order. I was in and out in ten minutes (so that in itself will make me more inclined to return). Every order that went by me looked really scrumptious. I ended up ordering the Bronx Club. It wasn't the best sandwich I ever had but it was pretty good. I wish there was more avocado in it, but I did like how the bacon was crispy and it was a huge sandwich so it filled me up. The baguette was fresh which made a world of difference- the bread can make or break the sandwich! There was also turkey in it from start to finish so you didn't go a bite with just bread. I think next time I'll try the Reuben or pastrami if I want a more flavorful sandwich, that seemed to be the popular choice around me. Overall, the sandwich hit the spot for a lunchtime meal.",

They definitely needed salt and free is always the best price. The Baja chicken was also quite good. I chose the baguette and it can lightly toasted.

I tried to place an online order and was prompted with a very confusing screen not mentioning what was in any of the sandwiches. I have to customize a lot because of my child and their customizations page listed every ingredient they have on their menu, meaning I had to select all the things I did not want on the sandwich. After 30 minutes ordering 2 sandwiches, I went to the store to have them tell me they couldn't start the order because they didn't understand it and they didn't have my number (which I did enter into the order). After explaining every thing I wanted, I returned home to find that our order was completely wrong and that they didn't follow any of our customizations and seem to have just created their own because even the salad (which was ordered as is) came completely different than was advertised. If they have an online ordering website then they need to make sure it's functional and that their employees know how to use it because the two workers that were there both had no idea. Additionally there was only one cook meaning it took a really long time. Seriously disappointed with this place. A plus I guess was that the bread was decent...",

We stopped by on a Saturday around noon and the place had only a few tables occupied. Maria was at the register and man did we feel some bad vibes off her. It must've been her first day although when asked, she responded it wasn't. She didn't know the menu, couldn't give recommendations, didn't know how to work the POS system, didn't know pricing, and had a stank face on. A line built up because she was slow AF and inexperienced. I ordered #17 (The Hitman) with extra pastrami, extra brisket, and a toasted baguette. When asked for meat pricing, she said $1 for double meat then changed it to $3 total. She ended up charging me $6. I didn't have the energy to go back in line and wait 10 mins for her to figure out how to refund $3. She also punched in a regular cold baguette. When I corrected that I asked for it to be toasted, rather than changing it, she argued, then angrily called over more staff to teach her how to use the system. SC got the Philly Cheesesteak on a toasted baguette with a side of fries. No problems there. We got home and unwrapped the sandwiches. Photos of my double brisket double pastrami are below this review. The cooks mentioned it would be 6oz of brisket & pastrami for a regular order so mine should came with 12oz. Does that look like 12oz of meat? That doesn't even look like 6oz. I got a cool portion of brisket and an extremely thin slice of pastrami. Thanks fam for the solid hookup. $18 for a regular sandwich with what looks like less than a normal portion. SC had no complaints about her sandwich so I assume it was delicious. I probably won't be back for another 6 months or so. Hopefully they can work put some kinks by then. For now, a $4 sprouts sandwich will do.",

            CustomerReviews: "It's an amazing place. I have sandwich places. I think sandwiches are overrated and I'm generally left still hungry after most sandwiches.This place is different. They use a variety of ingredients, freshly grilled. I bought the hot mess, which is really a mess, but it had a great flavor variety. The staff was friendly and helpful and the store was clean, conveniently located near other good stores.Why don't I give it 5 stars? It's $12 for a sandwich and we're not in LA where a PB&J would be $12. I think my price would be $8 for the sandwich. Also their home made chips taste boring. The chips have a near perfect texture, but somehow lack taste. They got the hard part done, they probably just need to salt them or something.",

There was a queue of people when I entered. Ordered a #8 pastrami with sauerkraut to go, total cost ~$12. Waited much longer than I would expect for a sandwich, but I do like the pager/buzzer. Opened up hoagie and found the baguette was undercooked. Not enough pastrami, too much sauerkraut. You could clearly see the wetness (read: undercooked) and density of the dough. It wasn't even brown on top and you could taste how undercooked it was. The hoagie has way too much 1000 island dressing and it soaked into the bread. Though I ate it I'm feeling queasy probably from the grease and the sauce. If I was closer I'd probably return it. Didn't want to waste my lunch. This was not good for a first experience. Maybe they are still getting operations in order.",

I got the boss and I didn't get any dressing on my sandwich and neither did my fianc\u00c3\u00a9. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 asked me if I got any dressing and I said nope. He was sooo mad and annoyed because he went after work to get it for us. Coming home and taking a bite of the sandwich and not getting exactly what you want is disappointing. Especially for a $13 sandwich!What sucks even more is we are in the middle of a move. So we have no sauce or nothing to even make this sandwich better or to at least the standard of what an Italian sandwich should taste like.

Definitely worth it's price and totally something I'd get again.As much as I enjoyed the Sloppy Bronx ($11.49), I wouldn't recommend it as it was very messy and probably on the stranger side as it is drizzled with spicy mayo and contains coleslaw. The sausage inside is good, but I wouldn't get this again since I would much rather have a lot more brisket or thinly sliced beef.The spicy Alabama fries are not spicy at all, but they're pretty good, I didn't try any of their other fries here, but I'd probably recommend trying their other fries as these were just good, but not outstanding.

I had the Bronx Club, and my guy had the Sloppy Bronx.. and while his sandwich was indeed sloppy, and my sandwich consisted of the necessary ingredients for a club, I found the sandwiches underwhelming.. the Bronx club describes the sandwich with crispy bacon...check out my pic and let me know if that looks like crispy bacon to you.. the sloppy Bronx had amazing ingredients but lacked flavor.. Now the street fries, however, were another story.. we tried the Texas bbq brisket fries---OH-EM--GEE.. those fries were amazing,, grilled onions with that perfect sweet and vinegary bbq brisket and melted cheese--it was the perfect combination.. Other info: customer service is great; staff is friendly and warm..   seating is inside and out, but chairs are  ehh  IMO..Overall, I just wasn't satisfied.. now this being my first time, I'll have to go back and try another sandwich before judgement, but for now, my number #1 remains with Ike's..",

We were excited that this location opened because we had eaten at the one in Tustin frequently before we moved. Everything is very fresh, very tasty and made exceptionally well. Portions are large and splitable (unless you are a big eater or extra hungry).   Unlike most chain sandwich shops this place doesn't skimp on the meat. It's piled high, a great quality and sliced thin. The veggies are fresh, the lettuce is crunchy and the avocado was actually ripe. My husband and I split the club, got two bags of chips and two drinks- it was about $24 and some change. You do get what you pay for here but the price will keep this from being our go to weekend sandwich spot (the other location is priced this way as well).

            CustomerReviews: "This branch of the Bronx Sandwich Company was okay. Nothing too special in terms of the food, but it was filling. I went today with some friends and we ordered different items on the menu. We ordered the Spicy Baja Grilled Chicken Fries, the West Coast Pastrami, and the Philly Cheese Fries with a side order of their House Potato Chips. The Baja Chicken Fries had bland fries that didn't stand out in terms of the flavor and texture. The fries seemed like they where just taken out of the freezer and straight to the deep-fryer and to my plate. The chicken and fajitas were not bad. The seasoning worked well, but on fries I would say no. Maybe the sandwich version is better. The West Coast Pastrami was okay as well. The sandwich did not have a savory flavor and the bread tastes like regular old bread. The Philly Cheese Fries were better than the Chicken Fries in terms of the meat and veggies. The cheese was melty and gooey in the beginning when I received the plate, but quickly hardens as time passes. I didn't mind too much since that's how provolone cheese is. The fries were okay as well. Same as how the fries for the Chicken Fries were.The house chips are what you expected. They're homemade potato chips and are a good addition to your sandwich if you need a side. No complaints about the chips. Better than the fries to be quite honest. The price for each entree didn't reflect the size and quality you would expect in other restaurants, especially with more delicious and less-costly substitutes.The location itself is modern and sleek. They also make sure to keep it clean as well from what I've seen. They have one of those new soda machines with a touch screen and had different soda selections to choose from, like the ones they have at movie theaters. Staff was friendly.Overall with four separate items tasted, the food was average and wasn't really expecting much to begin with before I tried it, even after looking at their menu online.

I consider myself somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur. My husband used Bronx   for catering for his work meetings, and his clients raved every time about the food. He has been told that they are willing to do more trainings as long as he brings more Bronx, haha. The first time he brought home some leftovers I knew I had to try them for myself.We have now gone to both the Tustin and the Costa Mesa locations and have had great service each time. Both the west coast and the east coast pastrami sandwiches are my favorite! The pastrami is literally the best I have ever had. It's not too heavy and perfectly portioned and paired   with the rest of the toppings. I decided to have Bronx cater a party I just hosted, and everyone raved about the salads and sandwiches. I especially loved the pear salad.   It was funny to watch grown men fight over pastrami...my bad for not ordering enough. My only complaint is I have to drive 20 minutes to get there!

Since most of the sandwich was refrigerator-tasting shredded lettuce, it was pretty tasteless and disappointing. My friend got the spicy Alabama though, he said it was pretty good! This lettuce in the picture is just from ONE sandwich .... and my pickles",

Having a newborn though it's a little harder to get out. Being on Grubhub and other delivery services has been exceptional. Good business decision. We always switch it up and try new sandwiches. Anything with pastrami is a must try. Also their loaded fries are all good, non have disappointed. Would definitely recommend this if you are wanting a sandwich. You have to top it off with a black and white cookie for dessert too!",

They are huge chips and delicious. I ordered a steak sandwich with deli mustard on a baguette and it was huge! This is a meal that you could easily share with another person. You can choose between a French baguette, sourdough, white or wheat bread which is also a nice option. I wish there was a location closer to home and I absolutely recommend this place. The staff is super kind and helpful as well.",

Both looked amazing but neither had any flavor. We ended up adding salt, pepper, and mustard to our sandwiches just to have a bit of flavor. For the price I expected much more refined sandwich with flavor but these two (completely different style sandwiches) just didn't deliver.",

Oh and the cookies for dessert looked amazing (I didn't try, I just drooled from afar). Prices are reasonable especially for the amount of food you get!The restaurant is modern and sleek. Very clean.

However, after this time, it's safe to say I will not be returning. Either their sandwiches do not much have much flavor or I just get someone who doesn't know how to make the sandwiches properly. Most recently, I ordered the Sloppy Bronx and the sandwich was dry. They left out the 3 different cheeses that were supposed to accompany the sandwich. The fries that came in the sandwich were cold and definitely NOT crispy and there was some mayo but it wasn't spicy. And there was very little coleslaw and meat... all contributing to a very bland and dry sandwich. Very disappointing. I will not be back when there are so many great sandwich places around.",

Went there for the first time a few days ago and just went back in again this evening and I can't get enough. Massive sandwiches with plenty of meat. You want a pastrami sandwich? You're getting fresh, THICK cut pastrami. The sandwiches are fantastic here. King of Queens is my favorite (so far) and the staff is incredibly friendly with a nice dining area to go with it. You can also call-in your order ahead of time which I just did and it was ready to rock right when I walked in. Can't wait to give some of the many different sandwiches on the menu a shot.

My main review is for the employee who helped us out. Logan!! He was amazing! He was helpful when we were ordering and very friendly. He kept checking in on us throughout our time there and brought us togo boxes without us having to ask. All in all I'd say it was a successful trip there.
