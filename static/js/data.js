CustomerReviews: "first off I came here on a Monday morning thinking on a slow day they would want the business. I pull up to place and the lady staff was setting up bikes outside. Before getting my question off she insisted on reminding me that they were not open till 10:00. Without a delay or hesitation she told me she could not do anything without her mechanic there.. So I guess she is just there to set up bikes I guess.. Nice job title.. Probably hire someone with more skill sets.so I got back in my car because asking my question just seemed wrong?? I guess. If I didn't need this part asap I would of rather gone to target or Walmart or gave my money to a homeless man before I give a cent to Two Wheels One planet .. They have rude staff and not very intelligent ones either. Train them in customer service not on how to ride bikes. I felt so bullied and threatened .now normally in customer service you want to make your customers feel welcomed. This lady is a joke, she is rude and had no customer service ! If this is the kinda of staff that this place chooses to hire then they will never see me again. We have lived off flower st our whole lives and have come to this place for all our biking needs because as a kid they made you feel welcomed .i will never return and will never ever recommend this place to anyone!!",

CustomerReviews: "Absolutely exceptional customer service. I needed two tune ups on my bikes and I was hoping to get them back by the end of the day-the shop was busy (as it is the last weekend before Christmas), but the warranty tech Brent was happy to help and went above and beyond to make sure everything was ready to go for me. When we walked in we were immediately greeted, and helped right away. While we were filling out the paper work for the bikes, we were approached by two different gentleman asking if we had been helped and if we needed anything to drink. I also saw one gentleman bring a cup of water to a guest that was waiting. Absolutely amazing customer service at a bike shop-I was impressed to say the least. I also needed assistance purchasing new front and rear lights for my bikes- Will was knowledgeable and explained my options and helped me find exactly what I was looking for. Great atmosphere in this shop... Everyone is eager to help, and you can tell that everyone is passionate about their jobs and they enjoy what they do. I highly recommend visiting this store for any biking or repair needs, and would certainly recommend that you ask for Brent or Will. Way to go guys!",

CustomerReviews: "after my incredibly shitty experience at two wheels one planet, i'm now dealing with the clusterfuck aftermath of a crappy installation.  my kickstand is sticking out and blocking the path of the pedals, and it looks like i'll have to adjust it myself.and the U-lock?  the mechanic installed it in the worst possible place: directly in front of the seat so it's sticking up and almost the same height as the seat.  i discovered how bad the location was today after making a quick stop which forced me to hop forward off my bike and onto -- yikes -- the lock.  my poor, poor lady parts!  WTF kind of place is this for a lock?!?!?  granted the way it mounts makes it difficult to put on my bike, but the least the mechanic could have done was to tell me this and suggest another lock rather than forcing this improper lock onto a horrible spot on my bike.i'm out almost a hundred bucks and have nothing to show for it except a smooshed crotch and a wonky kickstand.

It's working out well thus far.The store also supports the Bike Club of Irvine (BCI) which is a good reason to give them your business if possible.

Jonathan asked about my goals for the bike and walked though various options in my price range, explained the bands, differences in models, etc., and encouraged a few test rides.  Very no pressure explanations, very knowledgeable.  After a little more online research, I went back and bought the bike Jonathan thought would be ideal and could not be happier with my purchase.Having lived in the area for years, I've seen this shop hundreds, if not thousands of times, but had never been in.

The decor is great, lots of old and unique bicycle memorabilia all over the place. My biggest complaint about this place is the bikes that they sell. I'm not a big fan of the brands and or the quality. Back in the day they offered different brands and better quality bikes. I find myself buying my bikes at other bike stores and then serving everything here. I simply wish the this place offered a better selection.",

CustomerReviews: "Great place to get your biking gear. I've done indoor cycling for a few years now and have finally manned up and decided to take the next step in buying my own cycling shoes. So I decided to come here since the studio that I go to recommended this. I came here on a Sunday and it wasn't too packed. A staff member helped me pick out cycling shoes, but he seemed to not be too knowledgeable on cycling gear (didn't know the difference between SPD and LOOK compatible cycling clips). Nonetheless, he was very honest and oftentimes consulted senior staff about things he didn't know about. When I chose my shoes and clips, he was kind enough to set up our shoes. Really helpful staff, attentive, and great selection of cycling gear here. Definitely will go here for future cycling needs.",

After the sale, Matt called me back for a bike fitting (a place across the street was charging me 100 bucks for it) and spent a considerable amount of time with me on the trainer evaluating my position - he even showed me how to take my rear tire out and repair a flat.Hands down - the best bike shop I've been to in terms of customer service.

CustomerReviews: "I brought my bike in here to have the brakes and tire fixed. The grand total was about 105 bucks which seemed about right to me however, the very next day the tire went flat. I understand that sometimes things happen and this issue might not necessarily be their fault so I brought it in again. This guy told me to take some precautionary measures by buying some stuff called \"slime\" and in spite of what happened still charged me for replacing the tire. Two weeks later both tires go flat with slime in each of them. When I brought it back for a third time they assured me that if it's under the warranty they won't charge me for it. They charge me another $40 to have this fixed. This time it was for lining the insides of the rims or something. So I basically invested $185 at this place to have two tires fixed. The guys here seem nice but it's all bullshit. I came here because the yelp reviews but I won't be back. This company needs to stand by their service better.",

Dave even helped me load my bike in my truck and held the other for me to return for the following day...I will definitely recommend this shop to everyone and will return for my next bike too.",

CustomerReviews: "I highly recommend these guys. Here's how it breaks down:Pros:Super friendly and helpful staffCool shop rides that truly do cater to all levelsThe shop vibe...You can just hang out there and look at stuff on your own, or wrap with somebody who's passionate about cycling as well, or get advice on what to buy, but I guess the thing that's noteworthy is there's no pressure to buy anything.Service that exceeded my expectations. On several occasions I was quoted a 5 to 7 Day turn time for my bicycle repair only to receive a call within 48 hours saying it was ready :-). In addition, I've walked in there needing a minor repair on the way to a ride and they stopped what they were doing and got my bike dialed in, so I didn't miss my ride...That is what it's all about people. Pretty reasonable prices for a brick-and-mortar shop. The cats that work there are all cyclists. Cons:Apparently they're still using hand written repair tickets and dropping your bike off can take a minute. Maybe it's time you think about upgrading the system? Another thing that's really noteworthy is my friend purchased a road bike there. She had the bike about a week and took it on a few rides. A week later she learned she was able to purchase another bike (from a different shop) that was slightly lower priced and far better componentry. They gave her a 100% cash refund two weeks after she purchased the bike, no questions asked. They were super cool about the whole thing.",

CustomerReviews: "I just bought a New Trek FS7 Electric assisted Mountain Bike. If you haven't been to Two Wheels One Planet Bicycle I highly suggest you do. Will and Craig spent a few hours with me explaining all the different bikes and helped me to choose the right one for my riding ability/desire. They have a huge shop with lots of bikes to choose from, so I didn't feel like they were just pushing what they happened to have in stock. I even bought a bike for my 10 year old daughter. I'm really looking forward to a more active lifestyle with my family. Next purchase is another Trek FS7 for my wife now.

But here's the super good news, they would order it in for about $35 all totaled with tax and shipping! Huh? Just about the worst offer ever from a local retailer.

My latest purchase over a year ago was a Giant Bike and accessories, including a wireless odometer.  Two weeks later I brought the bike in for an adjustment like the sales person told me to do and was told they could make me an appointment in about 3 or 4 weeks yet another customer came in at the same time I did....a young girl and he took her bike right in.  Another service rep saw what was happening and rescued me, made a small adjust...took about 2 minutes or less and I was on my way.  Then I decided to give them another try and I've bought a few things in there for my bike.My battery died in my wireless computer so I had to reset it and I wasn't sure what size my wheels were so I dropped by and ask a guy in the service department if he could help me.  First he accused me of not buying the computer there and then he said he couldn't help me because he didn't know how to set it (he works in a bike shop!) and he would have to sit down and figure it out and he had other others he had to do.....although I noticed the store was pretty empty.  I grabbed it out of his hand and left the store for the last time.I will never go back into that bike store again.  Once you buy something you are on your own and they are rude to boot.  I have a large biking group of friends that I'm going to pass on the information of how I was treated.If that guy had worked for me he would be out of there.  Not good with people.Gail Ream",

I'm quite indecisive, and kind of a big pain in the ass, and they totally helped me! I haven't been on a bike in years (I fall off the stationary bikes in spin.

Chris helped me adjust the handlebars, seat, pick out a basket, bell AND the shop threw in FREE FREAKING BLING COVERS FOR MY TIRE VALVE.

I can't say enough wonderful things about this spot. Then they helped us two overly ambitious new bike owners cram a massive beach cruiser and a mountain bike in the hatchback of a Honda Insight. This was a strenuous process, and Chris stayed late to help us shove those suckers in safely.We checked out 3-4 other cycle shops in the area (CM, HB, NB) and this was by far the best. Best prices, bomb employees, and a wonderful selection. Not to mention no sales tax sale? Yes please. GO! We went in to look, and we came out with fully tricked out bikes. Whoops. They're that good! :)) THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING GUYS!!",

CustomerReviews: "LOVE this place!! A good friend of mine referred me to Two Wheels One Planet and told me to talk to Will. I was in need of a new bike seat and a bento box. Will took great care of me!Will also mentioned their Saturday morning group rides and a Thursday evening BYOB (bring your own bike) spin class. I utilized these training opportunities to help me get ready for my first Ironman 70.3. The maintenance team is also wonderful! They fixed up my bike and packed it up for my race in Mexico. =)I highly recommend Two Wheels One Planet for all your bike needs.",

CustomerReviews: "Maybe it was obvious i am not an avid biker.  It was hard to find someone willing to help me even though there were 3-4 staff standing around doing nothing.  When a young man finally did help me (if that was what you want to call it) he was not much help at all and I seemed to be a bother.I tested a bike in the parking lot w/o much assistance to fit.  I purchased the bike because it was on sale and seemed like a good price.  No one offered to assist in getting it in my vehicle.  When I got home with the bike it had a sticker on it saying to read the manuel.  I realized they did not give me a manuel.Maybe the bad service was because I am a woman who is not demanding but believes that good service s/b offered.  Anyway, if you are a female looking for good service it won't be offered at this store.Just my opinion, hope others have better experience.They did seem to have a good selection of bikes and helmets along with decent prices.  So maybe management will read this and give the boys on the store floor a lesson in customer service.",

I added on a cute bell and a rack in the back (sad it was extra) and also sad they don't make the racks to match the bike but none the less- I am so happy with my purchase! The bike was $10 cheaper than we saw anyplace else, and it was 10% off! Accessories were 15% off too (at the time) I think a week before Christmas. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.Long story short, I am the proud owner of my first Electra Beach Cruiser and so happy that I didn't just choose a Walmart bike! $250 well spent  Thanks again babe!

CustomerReviews: "My girlfriend and I purchased two Electra townie bikes with accessories. Our sales man Chris was very informative and helpful. For purchasing two bikes, they were nice enough to give us a accessory package discount. The only reason for not giving them five stars was their lack of communication at the end of the purchase. We had come down to Costa Mesa for the weekend and had friends with us. After the purchase the bikes we waited for about three hours for them, to do a check over on the new bikes. We just stood there not knowing how long it would take. We asked many times how much longer and we were told there working on them.Only if they had communicated with us our day would not of felt waisted.

CustomerReviews: "My man and I relocated here from the east coast and decided that even though we already have bikes, we needed cruisers. We both got Electra 7 speed townies outfitted with bells and baskets and some locks. The really positive things that stood out at this shop:*We walked in a few minutes before close to make the purchase, and they stayed late to outfit the bikes so we could use them that evening. Took about 45 minutes. In the past, when I've had baskets put on, I've had to wait hours or days. Awesome!*The prices are very fair. We had literally purchased the exact same bike as a gift for someone the week before in NY and paid $70 more. Great value.*Complimentary bike maintenance workshops the last Wednesday of every month. I'll definitely be there.*12 month no interest financing, if you need it. I've never seen a shop offer this service before.They didn't mention anything about a 30 day follow up service or free tune up after a year, which most bike shops offer standard. I forgot to ask and am not sure if this is included. I also did notice that their pricing for service seemed on the steep side compared to what I'm used to paying. For those reasons I knocked off a star. Otherwise, great inventory, great prices, fast friendly service.",

The usual stores I have been going into lately are filled with arrogant people who don't give great service unless you spend hundreds of dollars, but this place is different. I went in getting a simple truing only spending around $20 and they treated me like I was spending hundreds there. Because of the service I ended up spending around $200 to get a major tune up and accessories put on by a great guy named Brian. Super cool guy, straight forward, and if you don't know what your talking about they won't make you feel dumb. Highly recommend this place, will do another review about the tune up when I get my bike back after its serviced to inform you on the outcome. Also, they have a free cycling class on Thursday after they close, all you have to do is bring your own bike, that's awesome!",

CustomerReviews: "Since my former 24 Hour fitness spin instructor was opening up his own studio (Full Psycle also on 17th St.) I finally had to give in and get cycling shoes since his new studio would only accept those on their bikes and they recommended LOOK over SPD. Of course that made my life fun, since I had done some researching online and many of the shoes were SPD compatible but not as many choices were LOOK. Checked out other local bike shops for female LOOK compatible shoes for a  good price (was not willing to pay more $100+ and would only get it on sale or for a discount) but found out selections for female LOOK compatible shoes are limited.  Found 3 shoes that made my requirements at Two Wheels One Planet. They had a Bontrager that was compatible to both LOOK and SPD cleats but alas none were available in my size at the time (they are reordering more and can reorder more if you want).  I decided to go check out the HB REI (Tustin's REI sales selection wasn't as good) afterwards and found out they had spin shoes on sale so got my shoes there since the shoes were under $50 and I had gift certificate (WIN for me).   But since I wanted to support the local bike shop and cleats are cheaper here than at REI I got my LOOK cleats here. The staff was helpful and friendly and I got a 15% discount (only on full price items not sales) since it was a referral from Full Psycle and they helped to install the cleats on for me.",

CustomerReviews: "The best bike shop I've ever been to!We've been on the grand tour of bike shops in Orange County to find the right bike.  Of all the shops, mom-and-pop or corporate, Two Wheels One Planet was by far the most pleasurable shop to visit.  All the staff, especially Ryan, were extremely knowledgeable, friendly and most important not pushy or snobby like the staff at a few of the other shops in the area.I would whole heatedly recommend this shop whether you're an experienced cyclist or a newbie getting your first bike.  You won't be disappointed!",

I wanted a beach cruiser and they helped me pick the perfect bike for me and they immediately had it all ready to go and they delivered it to my house. The customer service was so great, I went back the following week and purchased a bike for my son. I highly recommend!",

CustomerReviews: "The first time I went in Hayden helped me try out different bikes and sent me home with a few bikes to look up so I could make the right choice. I really appreciated the time he took to show me a variety of bikes and teach me a bit about the different features. After some homework, I ordered a Trek FX 2 (2017) from these guys and they had it ready in less than a week. When I went to pick it up, Jonathan helped me get familiar with the bike and put on some of the accessories I had for it. It's my first bike (ever) and he took the time to explain everything I needed to know and then some. (Thanks, Jonathan!)Another awesome thing about this place is that they include a complete tune up after 90 days and free adjustments for the lifetime of the bike :) All in all, I am really happy I purchased my bike here. The service is excellent and the employees are knowledgeable and patient.",

I could not be more pleased with the shoes and my experience at Two Wheels One Planet. Dustin, the associate that applied my cleats was also very friendly, efficient  and helpful.

CustomerReviews: "There are several bike shops around Costa Mesa, but this is the best!  They have a great selection of bikes and accessories, but it is their staff that places them a cut above the competition.  The sales and service staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and they focus on doing all of the little things right.For example, earlier this week I dropped my bike (2001 Dyno Cruiser) off for a tune-up appointment with Lane in the service department.  My bike was promised by 6 the next day, but it was finished several hours early. I like that, because I LOVE my bike so much that I can't really imagine not having it for a week or two (yeah, I know I sound weird, but I really like riding my bike).  The is especially remarkable since everybody and their mom seemed to be having their bike tuned up for the summer this week.There was a short line when I picked my bike up, but Michelle in the service department was quick to acknowledge each customer in line. That kind of attention really makes customers feel important, it made me feel important.  I was also wowed at how quickly and efficiently she saw to it that each customer in line was taken care of.  Kind of made me want to give her a high five when I finally got to the counter!  I didn't, but maybe next time...In short, these guys treat their customers with respect.  Go see them and you'll know what I mean.",

I stopped by the service counter this morning to pick up a screw for my pedal. Pretty minor but I would rather have come here than anywhere else. Loyalty is earned after all.The guy on the service counter was immediately rude to me, stating that he wouldn't have time to look for a pedal screw for about three hours but I could leave my bike there until he found time. So I could wait three hours, pay the five bucks he quoted me for the screw or he suggested I buy new pedals.I was pretty pissed off at how rudely the guy met my request and don't think I deserved this attitude.Was it really worth losing a customer over a pedal screw? I think I can find other bike stores in the area.He was the older service guy with the grey hair.",

He showed us low and moderately priced bikes and didn't try to sell us more than we needed. I had done my homework on pricing for the bikes I thought we might buy, and their prices were the same as internet dealers--lower than a few, higher than one. Plus they had an end of the month special that saved us $150 if we spent $1,000 or more, which we did (the bikes were $599 and $499). We were out the door with bikes, helmets, locks, lights, lube and a few maps for about $1225, and the bikes were adjusted and fitted to us. Very happy.",

Absolutely NO pressure and we felt like he was legitimately there to help us find the perfect bike.  He encouraged my wife to ride a couple bikes and she fell in love with the Townie bike.  Jeff told us he had the bike in white but it wasn't built yet.  He called the next day like we requested and said the bike was built and ready for viewing.  We went back down and again he was very patient and attentive.  My wife rode a couple of the bikes again and eventually found the perfect bike for her.  We left the shop and went down to the strand and immediately went on about a 9 mile ride.  She loves the bike and we will continue to patronize this shop and it was a great experience.

However, I opted for a Giant Roam 1, men's small, and ended up at the Costa Mesa store, which is closer to where I live.  Also, thanks to Jared, in Lake Forest, who guided me to the perfect dual-sport bike for my needs!I can't explain how helpful they were in every category!  Accessories were added and liners were put in my tires and the bike was ready when promised.  They're easygoing and knowledgeable, which is the perfect combination for me.

CustomerReviews: "What is it with bike shops and poor customer service and spiteful, know-it-all jackasses? I came in here years ago to get a spoke repaired. I came back in to pick it up only to be told they needed to replace all of them. I looked at the wheel and they had put 3 spokes of the wrong color on my rim and tried to charge me for them. I refused and left. I wasn't trying to be an entitled ass, but they were such tools about it I couldn't help but return the favor. I should have learned my lesson.Fast forward to now and I need to get the same wheel respoked. Long story short the fix is twice the price of a new wheel set. This news was delivered to me so begrudgingly I almost barfed. There was one tech guy who was very nice, and I wish that I could put his name here because he's why they got an extra star. Not everyone knows EVERYTHING about bikes, that's why you have a service department.Long story short, I'm at City Grounds and am very happy.",

Before getting my question off she insisted on reminding me that they were not open till 10:00. Without a delay or hesitation she told me she could not do anything without her mechanic there.. So I guess she is just there to set up bikes I guess.. Nice job title.. Probably hire someone with more skill sets.so I got back in my car because asking my question just seemed wrong?? I guess. If I didn't need this part asap I would of rather gone to target or Walmart or gave my money to a homeless man before I give a cent to Two Wheels One planet .. They have rude staff and not very intelligent ones either. Train them in customer service not on how to ride bikes. I felt so bullied and threatened .now normally in customer service you want to make your customers feel welcomed. This lady is a joke, she is rude and had no customer service ! If this is the kinda of staff that this place chooses to hire then they will never see me again.

I needed two tune ups on my bikes and I was hoping to get them back by the end of the day-the shop was busy (as it is the last weekend before Christmas), but the warranty tech Brent was happy to help and went above and beyond to make sure everything was ready to go for me. When we walked in we were immediately greeted, and helped right away. While we were filling out the paper work for the bikes, we were approached by two different gentleman asking if we had been helped and if we needed anything to drink. I also saw one gentleman bring a cup of water to a guest that was waiting. Absolutely amazing customer service at a bike shop-I was impressed to say the least. I also needed assistance purchasing new front and rear lights for my bikes- Will was knowledgeable and explained my options and helped me find exactly what I was looking for. Great atmosphere in this shop... Everyone is eager to help, and you can tell that everyone is passionate about their jobs and they enjoy what they do. I highly recommend visiting this store for any biking or repair needs, and would certainly recommend that you ask for Brent or Will. Way to go guys!",

CustomerReviews: "after my incredibly shitty experience at two wheels one planet, i'm now dealing with the clusterfuck aftermath of a crappy installation.  my kickstand is sticking out and blocking the path of the pedals, and it looks like i'll have to adjust it myself.and the U-lock?  the mechanic installed it in the worst possible place: directly in front of the seat so it's sticking up and almost the same height as the seat.  i discovered how bad the location was today after making a quick stop which forced me to hop forward off my bike and onto -- yikes -- the lock.  my poor, poor lady parts!  WTF kind of place is this for a lock?!?!?  granted the way it mounts makes it difficult to put on my bike, but the least the mechanic could have done was to tell me this and suggest another lock rather than forcing this improper lock onto a horrible spot on my bike.i'm out almost a hundred bucks and have nothing to show for it except a smooshed crotch and a wonky kickstand.  DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HELLISH EXPERIENCE TO CONTINUE LONG AFTER YOU LEAVE THE STORE.",

CustomerReviews: "After researching the best seat pack for my race bike, I stopped by to purchase the Bontrager Mini Pack by TREK.  The sticker price on it was a few $$ more than the full retail price on the TREK website which is usually the highest retail price that you would pay for something.I showed the manager of the store the printout from TREK who made a price adjustment to TREK's price, and I purchased the pack.  It's working out well thus far.The store also supports the Bike Club of Irvine (BCI) which is a good reason to give them your business if possible.  BCI is a great community bike club for all skill levels.",

Jonathan asked about my goals for the bike and walked though various options in my price range, explained the bands, differences in models, etc., and encouraged a few test rides.  Very no pressure explanations, very knowledgeable.  After a little more online research, I went back and bought the bike Jonathan thought would be ideal and could not be happier with my purchase.Having lived in the area for years, I've seen this shop hundreds, if not thousands of times, but had never been in.

Nonetheless, he was very honest and oftentimes consulted senior staff about things he didn't know about. When I chose my shoes and clips, he was kind enough to set up our shoes. Really helpful staff, attentive, and great selection of cycling gear here. Definitely will go here for future cycling needs.",

I brought my Trek 830 mountain bike (1992 vintage) in for a tune up and new parts on March 20 and was told it would be ready on March 28. I received a call during lunch on March 23 and promptly went to pick up my ride. It was in beautiful condition. After riding it for the first time since the repairs, I can say I have never enjoyed riding that bike as much as I do now...after all this time.

After the sale, Matt called me back for a bike fitting (a place across the street was charging me 100 bucks for it) and spent a considerable amount of time with me on the trainer evaluating my position - he even showed me how to take my rear tire out and repair a flat.Hands down - the best bike shop I've been to in terms of customer service.

CustomerReviews: "I brought my bike in here to have the brakes and tire fixed. The grand total was about 105 bucks which seemed about right to me however, the very next day the tire went flat. I understand that sometimes things happen and this issue might not necessarily be their fault so I brought it in again. This guy told me to take some precautionary measures by buying some stuff called \"slime\" and in spite of what happened still charged me for replacing the tire. Two weeks later both tires go flat with slime in each of them. When I brought it back for a third time they assured me that if it's under the warranty they won't charge me for it. They charge me another $40 to have this fixed. This time it was for lining the insides of the rims or something. So I basically invested $185 at this place to have two tires fixed. The guys here seem nice but it's all bullshit. I came here because the yelp reviews but I won't be back. This company needs to stand by their service better.",

CustomerReviews: "I highly recommend these guys. Here's how it breaks down:Pros:Super friendly and helpful staffCool shop rides that truly do cater to all levelsThe shop vibe...You can just hang out there and look at stuff on your own, or wrap with somebody who's passionate about cycling as well, or get advice on what to buy, but I guess the thing that's noteworthy is there's no pressure to buy anything.Service that exceeded my expectations. On several occasions I was quoted a 5 to 7 Day turn time for my bicycle repair only to receive a call within 48 hours saying it was ready :-). In addition, I've walked in there needing a minor repair on the way to a ride and they stopped what they were doing and got my bike dialed in, so I didn't miss my ride...That is what it's all about people. Pretty reasonable prices for a brick-and-mortar shop. The cats that work there are all cyclists. Cons:Apparently they're still using hand written repair tickets and dropping your bike off can take a minute. Maybe it's time you think about upgrading the system? Another thing that's really noteworthy is my friend purchased a road bike there. She had the bike about a week and took it on a few rides. A week later she learned she was able to purchase another bike (from a different shop) that was slightly lower priced and far better componentry. They gave her a 100% cash refund two weeks after she purchased the bike, no questions asked. They were super cool about the whole thing.",

A lot of customers came in while I was there to visit and everyone had a couple questions.I'll come back for a challenge of history questions.Thanks guys!",

CustomerReviews: "I just bought a New Trek FS7 Electric assisted Mountain Bike. If you haven't been to Two Wheels One Planet Bicycle I highly suggest you do. Will and Craig spent a few hours with me explaining all the different bikes and helped me to choose the right one for my riding ability/desire. They have a huge shop with lots of bikes to choose from, so I didn't feel like they were just pushing what they happened to have in stock. I even bought a bike for my 10 year old daughter. I'm really looking forward to a more active lifestyle with my family. Next purchase is another Trek FS7 for my wife now. Check out my picture, I just took the bike out, first ride and in 30 minutes I climbed over 1,300 feet in 30 minutes!",

But here's the super good news, they would order it in for about $35 all totaled with tax and shipping! Huh? Just about the worst offer ever from a local retailer.

My latest purchase over a year ago was a Giant Bike and accessories, including a wireless odometer.  Two weeks later I brought the bike in for an adjustment like the sales person told me to do and was told they could make me an appointment in about 3 or 4 weeks yet another customer came in at the same time I did....a young girl and he took her bike right in.  Another service rep saw what was happening and rescued me, made a small adjust...took about 2 minutes or less and I was on my way.  Then I decided to give them another try and I've bought a few things in there for my bike.My battery died in my wireless computer so I had to reset it and I wasn't sure what size my wheels were so I dropped by and ask a guy in the service department if he could help me.  First he accused me of not buying the computer there and then he said he couldn't help me because he didn't know how to set it (he works in a bike shop!) and he would have to sit down and figure it out and he had other others he had to do.....although I noticed the store was pretty empty.  I grabbed it out of his hand and left the store for the last time.I will never go back into that bike store again.  Once you buy something you are on your own and they are rude to boot.  I have a large biking group of friends that I'm going to pass on the information of how I was treated.If that guy had worked for me he would be out of there.  Not good with people.Gail Ream",

I'm quite indecisive, and kind of a big pain in the ass, and they totally helped me! I haven't been on a bike in years (I fall off the stationary bikes in spin. I'm THAT bad), and they let me take out a beautiful cruiser a few times. Chris helped me adjust the handlebars, seat, pick out a basket, bell AND the shop threw in FREE FREAKING BLING COVERS FOR MY TIRE VALVE. This obviously cinched the deal in my mind that I'd found the best store ever. My husband got some fancy bike, and they sized him up and fit him to a perfect one also. I can't say enough wonderful things about this spot. Then they helped us two overly ambitious new bike owners cram a massive beach cruiser and a mountain bike in the hatchback of a Honda Insight. This was a strenuous process, and Chris stayed late to help us shove those suckers in safely.We checked out 3-4 other cycle shops in the area (CM, HB, NB) and this was by far the best. Best prices, bomb employees, and a wonderful selection. Not to mention no sales tax sale? Yes please. GO! We went in to look, and we came out with fully tricked out bikes. Whoops.

When I got home with the bike it had a sticker on it saying to read the manuel.  I realized they did not give me a manuel.Maybe the bad service was because I am a woman who is not demanding but believes that good service s/b offered.  Anyway, if you are a female looking for good service it won't be offered at this store.Just my opinion, hope others have better experience.They did seem to have a good selection of bikes and helmets along with decent prices.  So maybe management will read this and give the boys on the store floor a lesson in customer service.",

CustomerReviews: "My boyfriend and I had been to 4-5 other bike shops and after the sad realization that Electra does not make a 1-speed in yellow, I went with a bright pink Electra Beach Cruiser! I added on a cute bell and a rack in the back (sad it was extra) and also sad they don't make the racks to match the bike but none the less- I am so happy with my purchase! The bike was $10 cheaper than we saw anyplace else, and it was 10% off! Accessories were 15% off too (at the time) I think a week before Christmas. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help.Long story short, I am the proud owner of my first Electra Beach Cruiser and so happy that I didn't just choose a Walmart bike! $250 well spent  Thanks again babe!

CustomerReviews: "My girlfriend and I purchased two Electra townie bikes with accessories. Our sales man Chris was very informative and helpful. For purchasing two bikes, they were nice enough to give us a accessory package discount. The only reason for not giving them five stars was their lack of communication at the end of the purchase. We had come down to Costa Mesa for the weekend and had friends with us. After the purchase the bikes we waited for about three hours for them, to do a check over on the new bikes. We just stood there not knowing how long it would take. We asked many times how much longer and we were told there working on them.Only if they had communicated with us our day would not of felt waisted. We could of enjoy our limited vaca time and return later to pick up our new bikes.",

CustomerReviews: "My man and I relocated here from the east coast and decided that even though we already have bikes, we needed cruisers. We both got Electra 7 speed townies outfitted with bells and baskets and some locks. The really positive things that stood out at this shop:*We walked in a few minutes before close to make the purchase, and they stayed late to outfit the bikes so we could use them that evening. Took about 45 minutes. In the past, when I've had baskets put on, I've had to wait hours or days. Awesome!*The prices are very fair. We had literally purchased the exact same bike as a gift for someone the week before in NY and paid $70 more. Great value.*Complimentary bike maintenance workshops the last Wednesday of every month. I'll definitely be there.*12 month no interest financing, if you need it. I've never seen a shop offer this service before.They didn't mention anything about a 30 day follow up service or free tune up after a year, which most bike shops offer standard. I forgot to ask and am not sure if this is included. I also did notice that their pricing for service seemed on the steep side compared to what I'm used to paying. For those reasons I knocked off a star. Otherwise, great inventory, great prices, fast friendly service.",

The usual stores I have been going into lately are filled with arrogant people who don't give great service unless you spend hundreds of dollars, but this place is different. I went in getting a simple truing only spending around $20 and they treated me like I was spending hundreds there. Because of the service I ended up spending around $200 to get a major tune up and accessories put on by a great guy named Brian. Super cool guy, straight forward, and if you don't know what your talking about they won't make you feel dumb. Highly recommend this place, will do another review about the tune up when I get my bike back after its serviced to inform you on the outcome. Also, they have a free cycling class on Thursday after they close, all you have to do is bring your own bike, that's awesome!",

CustomerReviews: "Since my former 24 Hour fitness spin instructor was opening up his own studio (Full Psycle also on 17th St.) I finally had to give in and get cycling shoes since his new studio would only accept those on their bikes and they recommended LOOK over SPD. Of course that made my life fun, since I had done some researching online and many of the shoes were SPD compatible but not as many choices were LOOK. Checked out other local bike shops for female LOOK compatible shoes for a  good price (was not willing to pay more $100+ and would only get it on sale or for a discount) but found out selections for female LOOK compatible shoes are limited.  Found 3 shoes that made my requirements at Two Wheels One Planet. They had a Bontrager that was compatible to both LOOK and SPD cleats but alas none were available in my size at the time (they are reordering more and can reorder more if you want).  I decided to go check out the HB REI (Tustin's REI sales selection wasn't as good) afterwards and found out they had spin shoes on sale so got my shoes there since the shoes were under $50 and I had gift certificate (WIN for me).   But since I wanted to support the local bike shop and cleats are cheaper here than at REI I got my LOOK cleats here. The staff was helpful and friendly and I got a 15% discount (only on full price items not sales) since it was a referral from Full Psycle and they helped to install the cleats on for me.",

When I went to pick it up, Jonathan helped me get familiar with the bike and put on some of the accessories I had for it. It's my first bike (ever) and he took the time to explain everything I needed to know and then some.

During my most recent visit, I was interested in a new pair of cycling shoes. Will answered my questions, made comparisons, presented several options and eventually made an excellent recommendation. I could not be more pleased with the shoes and my experience at Two Wheels One Planet. Dustin, the associate that applied my cleats was also very friendly, efficient  and helpful. I highly recommend Two Wheels One Planet.",

They helped me with everything to get set up, and any problems I just bring them the bike and they take care of it right away. I think they focus on specific types of bikes, I got an Electra Townie and it's great for me. There may be other bike shops more suited to the hard core bicyclist, but if you are like me and are in need of expert help to start and maintain a biking habit, check out 2 Wheels 1 Planet!",

CustomerReviews: "There are several bike shops around Costa Mesa, but this is the best!  They have a great selection of bikes and accessories, but it is their staff that places them a cut above the competition.  The sales and service staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and they focus on doing all of the little things right.For example, earlier this week I dropped my bike (2001 Dyno Cruiser) off for a tune-up appointment with Lane in the service department.  My bike was promised by 6 the next day, but it was finished several hours early. I like that, because I LOVE my bike so much that I can't really imagine not having it for a week or two (yeah, I know I sound weird, but I really like riding my bike).  The is especially remarkable since everybody and their mom seemed to be having their bike tuned up for the summer this week.There was a short line when I picked my bike up, but Michelle in the service department was quick to acknowledge each customer in line. That kind of attention really makes customers feel important, it made me feel important.  I was also wowed at how quickly and efficiently she saw to it that each customer in line was taken care of.  Kind of made me want to give her a high five when I finally got to the counter!  I didn't, but maybe next time...In short, these guys treat their customers with respect.  Go see them and you'll know what I mean.",

I stopped by the service counter this morning to pick up a screw for my pedal. Pretty minor but I would rather have come here than anywhere else. Loyalty is earned after all.The guy on the service counter was immediately rude to me, stating that he wouldn't have time to look for a pedal screw for about three hours but I could leave my bike there until he found time. So I could wait three hours, pay the five bucks he quoted me for the screw or he suggested I buy new pedals.I was pretty pissed off at how rudely the guy met my request and don't think I deserved this attitude.Was it really worth losing a customer over a pedal screw? I think I can find other bike stores in the area.He was the older service guy with the grey hair.",

He showed us low and moderately priced bikes and didn't try to sell us more than we needed. I had done my homework on pricing for the bikes I thought we might buy, and their prices were the same as internet dealers--lower than a few, higher than one. Plus they had an end of the month special that saved us $150 if we spent $1,000 or more, which we did (the bikes were $599 and $499). We were out the door with bikes, helmets, locks, lights, lube and a few maps for about $1225, and the bikes were adjusted and fitted to us. Very happy.",

We knew we wouldn't be buying something the first day as the search had just begun.  The manager \"Jeff\" greeted us and was amazingly helpful.  Absolutely NO pressure and we felt like he was legitimately there to help us find the perfect bike.  He encouraged my wife to ride a couple bikes and she fell in love with the Townie bike.  Jeff told us he had the bike in white but it wasn't built yet.  He called the next day like we requested and said the bike was built and ready for viewing.  We went back down and again he was very patient and attentive.  My wife rode a couple of the bikes again and eventually found the perfect bike for her.  We left the shop and went down to the strand and immediately went on about a 9 mile ride.  She loves the bike and we will continue to patronize this shop and it was a great experience.

However, I opted for a Giant Roam 1, men's small, and ended up at the Costa Mesa store, which is closer to where I live.  Also, thanks to Jared, in Lake Forest, who guided me to the perfect dual-sport bike for my needs!I can't explain how helpful they were in every category!  Accessories were added and liners were put in my tires and the bike was ready when promised.  They're easygoing and knowledgeable, which is the perfect combination for me.

CustomerReviews: "What is it with bike shops and poor customer service and spiteful, know-it-all jackasses? I came in here years ago to get a spoke repaired. I came back in to pick it up only to be told they needed to replace all of them. I looked at the wheel and they had put 3 spokes of the wrong color on my rim and tried to charge me for them. I refused and left. I wasn't trying to be an entitled ass, but they were such tools about it I couldn't help but return the favor. I should have learned my lesson.Fast forward to now and I need to get the same wheel respoked. Long story short the fix is twice the price of a new wheel set. This news was delivered to me so begrudgingly I almost barfed. There was one tech guy who was very nice, and I wish that I could put his name here because he's why they got an extra star. Not everyone knows EVERYTHING about bikes, that's why you have a service department.Long story short, I'm at City Grounds and am very happy.",

The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.",

CustomerReviews: "Downtown Santa Ana has no shortage destinations to eat. Luckily I work super duper close and this was one of the first places I checked out. Specializing in fresh made to order kebabs, salads, wraps. This place deserves a gold star. Located on 4th street in the hope you find parking zone. Bring those quarters for the meter. Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread. Paired with garlic sauce and a green sauce. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. In fact, I couldnt help myself and busted open my box on my way home and grabbed a bite. It was so good. House made salad dressing was one of the best I've had.Service is friendly. The owner takes great pride in his food. Yelp check in scores you one free appetizer and drink.Can't wait to return.",

CustomerReviews: "Came here based off yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint, everything was wonderful!!! I'm so full right now shared the Sultan platter with my wife and we also had the sampler appetizer. The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again.

The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.",

Little shops that just give you good food.Walked up to the counter and grabbed a menu.  I had the chicken kebab platter.  The guy behind the counter who looked kind of like one of the bad guys from the Christopher Reeves Superman movie was super friendly.  Definitely not the bad guy.  He asked if I wanted half rice and half salad, which sounded perfect.  Grabbed a drink from the cooler, paid and we sat to wait for our food.  Another guy brought over a little something to chew on, which was good.  It didn't take long for the food to come by.  It was great.  So good.  The chicken had a little spice, but was perfect with the yogurt sauce they gave.I live nowhere near here, but if I was in the area, I would be there often.

CustomerReviews: "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.",

In the area that it's located, it was a super quiet street.  Everything is street parking with it being metered pay during the day.  It was very quiet for a lunch time with not too many people dining in.My biggest complaint was the service I received.  For the place not being so busy, it took forever for someone to take my order and then even longer for my food to come out.  The lady serving me was not very attentive and was very rude about everything.  She kind of threw my food on the table when she finally got it to me.  And when taking a peak back into the kitchen, everything done did not seem too sanitary.  The lady at the cash register was serving food in between taking orders and handing bills without washing her hands in between which I'm sure you're not suppose to do.On a positive note, they offer complimentary pita bread and a green herby dipping sauce which came out warm and delicious.

CustomerReviews: "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

CustomerReviews: "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.",

CustomerReviews: "First of all I don't even know how this place got bad reviews. I would come here again based off on the customer service alone. Rok runs the restaurant and has a fantastically friendly attitude.  My hunch is that he was probably the man who taught chick-fil-a there customer service skills! Lol Aside from the amazing customer service, the food was great. I eat Mediterranean food a few times a week and always make it a point to try new spots and I am very glad I came. Looks like this will be added to the rotationI ordered the combo kebab, chicken and steak with half rice and salad. It also came with complimentary warm pita and a tasty dipping sauce. The meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everything was tender, fresh, and aromatic. You could tell they put a lot of TLC into there food. Overall no complaints here! Now What are you waiting for go try it! Thank you Rok!",

CustomerReviews: "The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.",

CustomerReviews: "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.",

CustomerReviews: "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.",

I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!",

The greek stoner fries with waffle fries, gyro meat, tzaziki sauce and feta were amazing.  We had the sultan plate with the chicken kebab, steak kebab, and kibbeh kebab.  Not a big fan of kibbeh in general, but my wife like it.  The steak kebab was good, but the chicken kebab was amazing, juicy, tender, and flavorful.  We tried a felafel appetizer as well which was also very good.  We will come back next time we are in the area.",

CustomerReviews: "We came in tonight just before closing. Usually not a good thing to do as the pickings can be slim and the quality unknown. Boy we're we wrong. It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight. We will be back.",

CustomerReviews: "I decided to come to Kebab Place based off of the location and the reviews. The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.",

When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad",

At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

CustomerReviews: "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.",

I had the salmon kebab and I couldn't have been happier. Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it.

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.",

Yelp reviews didn't let me down as this place has great food and owner was real appreciative of our business. Kebab meat from salmon, beef, and chicken was cooked perfect. Everything was flavorful from pita bread to meat to veggies and sauces. Portions are good as well!",

I knew there was a problem when the couple behind me was served their food prior to mine...and they had full plate dinners.  I was brought the wrap with French fries.  I waited another 10 minutes to be brought two burnt small felafel.  The gyro meat was a bit too salty.  Sorry",

I had the salmon salad with some pita on the side. The salmon had a crispy sear on the outside but soft on the inside, just delish.  The pita was really warm and soft. I could've made a meal out of the pita and assorted dips alone, it was that good. Restaurant was clean, food came out quick and the new owner was really nice and energetic.

CustomerReviews: "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!",

CustomerReviews: "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.",

Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

Prior to my arrival I phoned the establishment and spoke with Gita who was very sweet in taking down my order and provided some tips on keeping the food/dessert fresh out in the desert. Once I got to kebab place, I was greeted by Gita and a gentleman named Rock (owner) who was speaking very highly of the food and baklava. We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten. My campmates also appluaded the quality of the baklava and I was compelled to leave a positive review!!! Will definitely be seeing Rock and Gita in the near future.",

CustomerReviews: "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.",

When I tried to order in person what I had ordered thru doordash one week prior, he told me their system was different and that he'd have to charge me for two separate kabobs which came out to $5 extra.. so $20 for one plate! The right thing to do from a customer service standpoint would've been to honor that price shown online. Very disappointing. Won't bother going there again.",

My husband And I both had the Kevin plate which came with your choice of meat, grilled veggies an option for half salad and half rice. Pitta bread with a side dipping sauce was also provided. The food was fresh and flavorful! The portion size is large and fulfilling. We are already planning to try the grilled salmon kebob next time.  If your not in the mood for kebobs, they also have burgers and gyros with fries. The customer service is warm and friendly, with family owned vibes.

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.",

It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalape\u00cc\u00c4\u00e5\u00b1o cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice. Well priced for the amount and quality of food Inside the place is small but clean. Would definitely go back again when in the area.",

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice.

It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less.

The rice was also well done and authentic.  A grilled Hot Pepper was served on the site with a grilled tomato garnish.  The tzakiki sauce is REALLY good!Over all, an excellent experience.  Great for a date with cozy tables!Loved it!",

Thank you for coming to DTSA!I stepped out of my salon to have lunch and didn't want to frequent my usual spots Crave or Cafe Calacas (both are wonderful !) so I kept walking down 4th and walked past this spot but made a u-turn straight into this spot!I believe I met the owner who was very nice and charming. The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio. My clients will love the quality of freshness from this great spot!I will be back and I have been spreading the word so hopefully they are here to stay!",

I had the gyros wrap and it was amazing! It had so much meat on it and the meat had perfect flavor.  It was a large portion too.....I was really full afterward!Some of my lunch partners had the kabob plate and it was a kabob, rice, and salad and they said it was great too. We were able to walk here, order, eat, and make it back on time with 10 mins to spare. If you are in jury duty, I recommend walking here for lunch....it beats the court cafeteria by far!!

CustomerReviews: "So I would give this place five stars for the quality of their food but was not happy with their service. We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good",

The rice was also great, especially when combined with the yogurt sauce. My son ate the steak plate and thought it was delicious. Food all seemed fresh, and customer service was wonderful. Will definitely be back for more.",

It's not the kind you put in the office that's frozen, no this is the true legit stuff that comes off a spit!  The portion sizes are nice so you won't leave hungry.  The pita's are fresh and warm.  The tzatziki sauce is really flavor full.  The hummus isn't bad but it's not my cup of tea...it's very heavy in the garlic department so if your warding off vampires you will love this!",

The seasoned fries are bomb ASF, super delicious, made as soon as you order! By far the greatest tasting food in DOWNTOWN! Great place, small but great for social gatherings. I visit almost daily .

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!",

It is really delicious. The falafel tastes homemade,has lots of flavor, is nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It's one of the better falafel's I've had before. The place is quaint and seems clean. Always a good thing. The parking is all paid in this area, but there is a garage around the corner. I think these are going to be a new craving for me. :-P",

I travel for my job and ty every Greek restaurant within 10 or so miles of my destinations, and without question, the Kabob Place is the best. Everything is fresh (nothing frozen); all the sauces are made in house and are made that day; the pita break is baked in house and tastes like it just came out of the oven. Perhaps, most importantly, the owner has captured the essence of Greek hospitality. A person in my party had the salmon and described it as a religious experience. You must try the Kabob Place. Quite simply, it 's a game changer.. If you're from out of town, it will become a reason to come back to Santa Ana. If you're close by, you will be back!",

The food was exceptionally tasty- the seasoning, tenderness, and chargrilled flavor left nothinggggggg to be desired. We had a pretty good variety with the sampler appetizer platter and 2 entrees with chicken, koobideh and grilled vegetables. The salad was one of the best Ive ever received as a side from any mediterranean place. The produce was really high quality I could tell by its robust flavor and texture- which the dressing was just a nice accent really. The owner was very hospitable and the service was just right from a Pay at the counter type eatery. Thanks a bunch- we'll be back soon!",

The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws.

The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again. Staff were extremely friendly and inviting as well as helpful in menu selection. Bistro style inside, quaint and comfortable. We will be back, got a lot more menu to try!",

CustomerReviews: "If you don't eat a lot of Lebanese/Persian food, then the food seems good, but bad Persian food is still good. Compared to most places, the food is only okay. The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.",

CustomerReviews: "If you are looking for mediocre Mediterranean, then don't come here! This place is fantastic!!! Fresh, flavorful, locally sourced meats and veggies and house made sauces. As a family we eat low carb / Keto, so we are meat and veggie connoisseurs. The salmon, chicken, steak, gyro and hamburgers were all top notch! The portions are huge. The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated and the food was presented beautifully. We are visiting from out of state and have eaten at a couple of fine dining establishments that couldn't compare with the food we ate here. The owner / manager was so nice and accommodating.

I don't understand how a restaurant could allow themselves to get that disgusting. Don't you disinfect and sanitize the entire kitchen? Obviously not if the city has to come shut the establishment down because of such unhealthy working environment. Unfortunately the owner of the company the more mature lady was always rude and angry when approached. I try to make an order and she gave me a look of disgust.

Little shops that just give you good food.Walked up to the counter and grabbed a menu.  I had the chicken kebab platter.  The guy behind the counter who looked kind of like one of the bad guys from the Christopher Reeves Superman movie was super friendly.  Definitely not the bad guy.  He asked if I wanted half rice and half salad, which sounded perfect.  Grabbed a drink from the cooler, paid and we sat to wait for our food.  Another guy brought over a little something to chew on, which was good.  It didn't take long for the food to come by.  It was great.  So good.  The chicken had a little spice, but was perfect with the yogurt sauce they gave.I live nowhere near here, but if I was in the area, I would be there often.

CustomerReviews: "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.",

Sadly, the experience I had here was truly a disappointment and deterred from any of the positives I experienced.I visited this establishment during lunch time to grab a quick bite.  In the area that it's located, it was a super quiet street.  Everything is street parking with it being metered pay during the day.  It was very quiet for a lunch time with not too many people dining in.My biggest complaint was the service I received.  For the place not being so busy, it took forever for someone to take my order and then even longer for my food to come out.  The lady serving me was not very attentive and was very rude about everything.  She kind of threw my food on the table when she finally got it to me.  And when taking a peak back into the kitchen, everything done did not seem too sanitary.  The lady at the cash register was serving food in between taking orders and handing bills without washing her hands in between which I'm sure you're not suppose to do.On a positive note, they offer complimentary pita bread and a green herby dipping sauce which came out warm and delicious.  The gyro meat was decent, a little on the salty side.  It was a good portion sizing for one person.",

CustomerReviews: "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

Now onto the chicken, it's always super moist and delicious, definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate along with the basmati rice and their delicious salad. Last but not least the PITA bread!!!!

CustomerReviews: "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up!

I had lamb, koobideh (ground beef) and the chicken kebab and man was I pleasantly surprised. The seasoning from the meat to the salad and the sauces were really on point. I usually don't care for rice but this was buttery infused with saffron. Yum! Staff are super friendly, they're truly here because they want to be. I highly recommend stopping by if your in the downtown Santa Ana neighborhood. I can't wait to come back for more. Thanks guys!",

CustomerReviews: "The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.",

CustomerReviews: "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.",

CustomerReviews: "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.",

It is tiny shop closer to the Courthouse than the new renovations in DTSA, but worth trying if you are looking for Greek and Mediterranean food.  I wouldn't call it fusion, but they do step away from some of the traditional fare to cater to a more diverse set of tastes, but hey, that is what food in So Cal is all about.It definitely hit the spot for the day, and it is a place worth going back to again./",

CustomerReviews: "I would never have found this great Persian kabob place if not for the 2017 rendition of Savor Santa Ana. I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!",

The greek stoner fries with waffle fries, gyro meat, tzaziki sauce and feta were amazing.  We had the sultan plate with the chicken kebab, steak kebab, and kibbeh kebab.  Not a big fan of kibbeh in general, but my wife like it.  The steak kebab was good, but the chicken kebab was amazing, juicy, tender, and flavorful.  We tried a felafel appetizer as well which was also very good.  We will come back next time we are in the area.",

CustomerReviews: "We came in tonight just before closing. Usually not a good thing to do as the pickings can be slim and the quality unknown. Boy we're we wrong. It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight. We will be back.",

CustomerReviews: "I decided to come to Kebab Place based off of the location and the reviews. The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.",

CustomerReviews: "Service-poor.  I was the only one in line and it still took almost 10 minutes to place my order. Woman at the register was unfriendly,uncommunicative and barely spoke. When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad",

However, it was incredibly soggy already as the juices from the meat had permeated the wrapping. At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

CustomerReviews: "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.",

The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant.

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.",

Roc was very easy to work with and allowed me to customize my order that made sense for my event. Delivery was on time and most importantly, food was GREAT. Everyone complimented on the food and kept inquiring on where I ordered from. You won't be disappointed!",

CustomerReviews: "Great local eatery with fresh, flavorful ingredients and authentic menu with a little bit of American goodness. Food quality is excellent. I had the salmon salad with some pita on the side. The salmon had a crispy sear on the outside but soft on the inside, just delish.  The pita was really warm and soft. I could've made a meal out of the pita and assorted dips alone, it was that good. Restaurant was clean, food came out quick and the new owner was really nice and energetic. We were occasion visitors before but will definitely make it a regular thing. They have a really creative breakfast menu I'd like to try. See you there!!",

CustomerReviews: "Our new favorite Mediterranean place.Our first time in here and we were greeted by the friendly  owner who suggested we should try the sultan platter. We ordered 2 of the platter and substituted salmon on one. Food is so good. Flavorful. And the meat is very tender. Sauces are so good as well. Just as what we expected it to be. The naan bread is a hit. Overall was a great experience. Place is very clean and organized. We will definitely come back again soon.",

CustomerReviews: "I ordered the steak (filet mignon) wrap with fries. I wasn't a huge fan of the wrap but it wasn't bad. The fries were both crunchy and soft, which was perfect, but needed salt or seasoning. The sandwich cost about $14. I am probably going to go back and try another menu item. The restaurant advertises the food as halal. There  is a parking structure close by right across the street from the court house and max parking rate is $7",

CustomerReviews: "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!",

CustomerReviews: "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.",

On a cold evening, it was the perfect place to warm up and get a great meal!Location:  The restaurant is a little tough to spot because it's between stores.  It's worth the search!

Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

Prior to my arrival I phoned the establishment and spoke with Gita who was very sweet in taking down my order and provided some tips on keeping the food/dessert fresh out in the desert. Once I got to kebab place, I was greeted by Gita and a gentleman named Rock (owner) who was speaking very highly of the food and baklava. We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten.

CustomerReviews: "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.",

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty. But that was all.Totally a rip off, I won't go back.",

This place has the best kabob and salad dressing! Sometimes I just buy the hummus and the dressing then I cook at home. I know the place has lots of business during dinner so I can't understand why they would be closing early. Gida is so sweet. She is always gracious and helpful.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.",

It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalape\u00cc\u00c4\u00e5\u00b1o cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice. Well priced for the amount and quality of food Inside the place is small but clean. Would definitely go back again when in the area.",

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. Spot is great. Definitely coming back. The guys here do a top notch job. Supporting small places like this is a must. Try them out.",

It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less.

CustomerReviews: "What a gem! Thank you for coming to DTSA!I stepped out of my salon to have lunch and didn't want to frequent my usual spots Crave or Cafe Calacas (both are wonderful !) so I kept walking down 4th and walked past this spot but made a u-turn straight into this spot!I believe I met the owner who was very nice and charming. The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio. My clients will love the quality of freshness from this great spot!I will be back and I have been spreading the word so hopefully they are here to stay!",

I had the gyros wrap and it was amazing! It had so much meat on it and the meat had perfect flavor.  It was a large portion too.....I was really full afterward!Some of my lunch partners had the kabob plate and it was a kabob, rice, and salad and they said it was great too. We were able to walk here, order, eat, and make it back on time with 10 mins to spare. If you are in jury duty, I recommend walking here for lunch....it beats the court cafeteria by far!!

The chicken was marinated to perfection and was the best chicken I have had that I can recall.  The bed of saffron rice was delicious and the salad and the dressing was nice compliment to the rest of the food.  The stoner fries were a big hit and is definitely great as a shareable.

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good",

The seasoned fries are bomb ASF, super delicious, made as soon as you order! By far the greatest tasting food in DOWNTOWN! Great place, small but great for social gatherings. I visit almost daily .

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!",

CustomerReviews: "Wow! This is a truly authentic Greek restaurant. I travel for my job and ty every Greek restaurant within 10 or so miles of my destinations, and without question, the Kabob Place is the best. Everything is fresh (nothing frozen); all the sauces are made in house and are made that day; the pita break is baked in house and tastes like it just came out of the oven. Perhaps, most importantly, the owner has captured the essence of Greek hospitality. A person in my party had the salmon and described it as a religious experience. You must try the Kabob Place. Quite simply, it 's a game changer.. If you're from out of town, it will become a reason to come back to Santa Ana. If you're close by, you will be back!",

CustomerReviews: "OMG! SUCH A GREAT FIND. This place is so cute- right in DTSA on 4th street. The interior decor is so colorful and made me feel like I was at a little eatery somewhere in Turkey. The food was exceptionally tasty- the seasoning, tenderness, and chargrilled flavor left nothinggggggg to be desired. We had a pretty good variety with the sampler appetizer platter and 2 entrees with chicken, koobideh and grilled vegetables. The salad was one of the best Ive ever received as a side from any mediterranean place. The produce was really high quality I could tell by its robust flavor and texture- which the dressing was just a nice accent really. The owner was very hospitable and the service was just right from a Pay at the counter type eatery. Thanks a bunch- we'll be back soon!",

CustomerReviews: "I went to Kebab place on Saturday for the first time based on a recommendation from a close friend. The restaurant has a very nice and pleasing atmosphere with great music playing in the background. I couldn't make up my mind on which of their protein options to choose so I ordered the Sultan Platter and got the Steak kebab, chicken and for the third option I got the Gyro (beef and lamb mixed). The food was really amazing and fresh. You HAVE to try the cilantro sauce (comes with the platter). I also got to meet the chef which was nice. I highly recommend Kebab Place if you are looking for no frills great food with a nice atmosphere you should check them out.",

CustomerReviews: "I LUV, LUV, LUV the Kebab Place.  My usual is the salmon kebab (they grill it perfectly), and the chicken kebab is surprisingly moist for chicken breast meat.  A lot of places usually overcook chicken breast and it tends to be dry and hard to swallow, but not at the Kebab Place.  When I have lunch there next week, I'm going to ask the cook if he will grill the lemon wedge they give you on the side.  The staff is very courteous.",
